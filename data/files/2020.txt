# Vattanac Digitalization

Cambodia has developed very fast in all sectors in the Techo Era. The Digital Sector has grown significantly in the context of the Industrial Revolution 4.0. The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic that started since early 2020 has severely impacted the economy in the short term and medium term. Digital technology now plays a very important role in ensuring the sustainability of most economic activities.

Vattanac Bank is optimistic, confident and committed to the development of better Digital Banking Services, thereby facilitating smart and modern lifestyle for the customers. Vattanac Bank’s Mobile Banking App was developed by the Bank’s Cambodian Digital Banking team and officially launched in 2020. The team has been enhancing the App’s functionalities, user experience and performance, while also continuously introducing new features since its launch.

Vattanac Bank’s digitalization of products and services provides effective and timely solution to meet Cambodian’s demand for a modern, convenient, fast and secure financial service in line with the development of communication and information technology in the context of Industrial Revolution 4.0. During this prolonged pandemic, Vattanac Mobile Banking has enabled customers to continue to perform their daily banking transactions, showing our fast adaptability to the “new normal”.

# Statement to Stakeholders

## Message from Neak Oknha Chairman and Neak Oknha President

> "We serve with honesty and professionalism."

**Neak Oknha SAM ANG**  
Chairman

2020 was a challenging year for Cambodia as well as the rest of the world where socio-economic well-being was adversely impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Some of our customers were not spared from experiencing negative effects in their businesses, too. Vattanac Bank, therefore, addressed those customers' banking concerns efficiently and effectively since we consider serving the customers as our main focus in accordance with our corporate vision and mission.

Although Vattanac Bank suffered the impact of Covid-19 pandemic, due to our commitment and perseverance, we still managed to digitalize our products and services and expand our branch network as planned. We believe that our digitalization and branch expansion could provide some relief to our customers under these challenging circumstances.

**ANNUAL REPORT 2020**

> "Make new but keep the old"

**Neak Oknha CHHUN LEANG**  
**President**

---

We are excited and feel secure by the Shareholders’ visionary investment in digital technology and branch expansion nationwide. Year after year, as a local bank that has established roots in the Cambodian banking sector, we are very optimistic about achieving the goal of making **Vattanac Bank** a brand that is the most reliable and reflects our core values and corporate culture of providing service with **honesty and professionalism** to all customers.
---
# Branch Expansion

Despite the prolonged Covid-19 pandemic, in 2020 we implemented our business plan and managed to open 7 more branches:

- one branch in Phnom Penh and
- 6 branches in provinces
  - Suong-Tboung Khmum
  - Kampong Thom
  - Pailin
  - Krong Paoy Paet
  - Kampong Chhnang and
  - Kratie

All the branches are in high-rise buildings constructed by the Bank’s shareholders and strategically located to serve the local communities.

# Human Resource Development

Although Vattanac Bank was affected by the Covid-19, we did not take the option of reducing the number of staff because we always value the relationship between the bank and every employee. Based on the adage – “Make new but keep the old,” Vattanac Bank focused on strengthening existing workforce and finding additional human resources for the new branches and new departments of the Head Office, thereby increasing the total number of employees to 643 by the end of 2020 as planned.

In addition, to encourage capacity development and to meet the human resource needs of our existing and new branches, Vattanac Bank established two new departments:
- The Learning and Development Department and
- The Branch Support Department

Many training courses were provided to the staff, including those organized by Institute of Banking and Finance and our in-house courses. In this context, Vattanac Bank is like a university that always provides opportunities for all staff to acquire new knowledge and skills and improve themselves to become key staff in the Bank and good citizens of the country.

# Statement to Stakeholders

## Investment in Digital Sector

Despite the difficulties caused by Covid-19 pandemic, Vattanac Bank continued to move forward vigorously and provided opportunities for Cambodians to show their capability through our investment in digitalization. As a result, we were able to modernize our Internet Banking and provide new digital products and services. Our Mobile Banking App, which was our new product developed by our Cambodian Digital Banking team, was officially launched in 2020.

Vattanac Mobile Banking provides customers with many essential functions for safe and easy financial transactions. With the growing trust and support from our customers, the team has continued developing the app to provide more features as well as improve the existing ones, making it smarter and more secure.

## Peace Brings Development

“Thank you, Peace” gives the private sector in Cambodia the opportunity to grow gradually and join the government in giving back to society by promoting social development and economic growth in all Cities and Provinces of Cambodia. Trusting the Royal Government, the shareholders of Vattanac Bank have no hesitation to invest in land and build Bank branches. The Bank’s decision to invest in expanding its branch network does not only respond to the needs of investors, business people and the general public for financial services of the Bank - considering the Bank as their honest, professional and trusted business partner; but also contributes to promoting development in a branch’s area and neighboring areas by bringing modern office buildings, generating jobs, strengthening human resource skills, etc. These contribute constructively to socio-economic development under the wonderful shade of Peace.

We sincerely hope that all the other shareholders and the Board of Directors of Vattanac Bank will continue to fully support us and to continue promoting the progress of Vattanac Bank by expanding our branch network as the current number of our branches may not be sufficient to meet the overwhelming needs of customers now and in the near future.

---
# 2021 Target

Vattanac Bank will continue to expedite our planned branch network expansion to all Cities and Provinces in order to bring banking services close to customers as well as strive to modernize and diversify our banking services in consonance with the development of digital technology.

**CHAN KOK CHOY**  
Chief Executive Officer

## Introduction

The Covid-19 pandemic, which started in early 2020, was a test of our flexibility and resilience to adapt our banking operations to unexpected changes. Vattanac Bank has introduced a series of strategic measures to reach new milestones towards our vision and mission despite the crisis.

---
# Financial Performance

As at 31 December 2020, Vattanac Bank recorded key financial performance as follows:

- Total assets increased by 13% to US$812M, compared to 2019.
- Deposits grew by 13% to US$697.2M.
- Loans increased by 4% to US$378.1M, of which loans in Riel constituted 12.8%. Loans in Riel stood at KHR195.2 Billion (US$ 48.2 Million) or 12.8% of our total loans outstanding as at 31 Dec. 2020. Our Non-Performing Loan (NPL) was 0.03%.
- Under the government’s initiative, we joined the Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SME) Co-financing Scheme by disbursing total loans of KHR4.84 Billion to support SMEs in Cambodia.
- Our Bank’s loans to deposits ratio was low at 54%
- Our liquidity was strong at 222.54% compared to NBC’s requirement for liquidity ratio of 100%.
- The Bank’s solvency ratio stood at 20.12% as against NBC’s solvency ratio requirement of 16.25%.
- The Bank’s pre-tax profit declined by 20% in 2020 to US$10.2 Million compared with the previous year due to the modest growth of 9% in interest income while interest expenses increased by 21%.
- Total operating expenses and personnel expenses increased by 27% each in 2020 mainly due to the opening of 7 new branches and new staff recruitment to implement the Bank’s branch network expansion plan.

The Bank complied with all prudential requirements of NBC in 2020.

Vattanac Bank has been implementing NBC’s guidelines on loans restructuring aimed at providing relief to borrowers facing difficulty in making their repayment during the challenging period of the Covid-19 pandemic in support of the national economic policy.

In addition, even under the circumstances caused by Covid-19, Vattanac Bank has not retrenched staff, has continued to pay taxes diligently, and has been ranked 70th largest tax payer. We have also been awarded the Gold Certificate of Tax Compliance 2020-2021 by the General Department of Taxation.

Vattanac Bank has also continued to invest in developing and upgrading our digital banking infrastructure to provide customers with more modern, diverse, convenient and fast banking services.

# Progress of Digital Banking

Digitalization was our priority in 2020 to respond to the needs of customers for digital payments.

- **Mobile Banking**
  - The Mobile Banking App was developed, went under strict penetration testing and obtained certification from Thales, a technology company well known for data security solutions and services. After being launched at the end of July 2020, Vattanac Mobile Banking has gained growing support from customers. Vattanac Bank Mobile Banking App is safe, and easy for customers to use for financial transactions.
---
# Internet Banking
Internet Banking was successfully enhanced to provide better user experience. The Bank launched the next generation internet banking platform and OTP system to allow customers to securely perform banking transactions anywhere and anytime.

The Bank’s website was given a facelift with a more contemporary interface. The new website is set to be launched in early 2021.

# Bakong
The Bank actively supported NBC’s Bakong, successfully incorporating it into the Mobile Banking and Internet Banking interface.

# Contactless VISA and MasterCard
The Bank launched Vattanac Bank VISA contactless cards in July 2020 and Vattanac Bank Mastercard contactless cards in December 2020. Additional protection was introduced to customers with the block and unblock card feature using the internet banking and mobile banking.

Vattanac Bank had 3 IT departments in 2020 working towards digitalization:
- IT Security
- IT Applications
- Digital Banking

The 3 departments worked together to promote the development and enhancement of the Bank’s digital infrastructure. Due to the growing need of customers and the faster pace of technological advancement, the Bank decided to expand its IT structure by establishing the 4th department - IT Governance in 2021 in order to diversify and digitalize products and services to bring the Bank up to speed with its competitors.

# International Awards
In 2020, the Bank received several awards:
- Customer Satisfaction and Happiness Award – Cambodia, and Best Bank for Corporate Governance Cambodia from Global Business and Finance Review;
- Leadership in Average Spend VISA Mass Credit 2020 Award from VISA
- Best Customer Service Bank Cambodia, and Best Corporate Governance Bank Cambodia from International Business Magazine.

# Customer Service
Our customer service passed the test of consistency as the Bank had promptly addressed the concern for customers’ convenience and health from the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. Every effort was made to not only maintain but surpass the service standard we have always adhered to despite the constraints faced. The Bank reviewed procedures and service standards of departments and branches to ensure a customer-centric focus. A Customer Care Campaign, the 16th for the bank, was held at Garden City Hotel on 9th November to review the Bank’s service standard and enhance the staff’s delivery of service at the branches.

# Contributing to COVID-19 Prevention
To ensure the safety of customers and staff, all branches of Vattanac Bank carefully implemented health measures introduced by the Royal Government to prevent the spread of Covid-19.

In addition, Vattanac Bank donated US$1M and raised funds for the Royal Government to help buy Covid-19 vaccines.
---
# The Future

Despite the uncertainty caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, we look forward to 2021 with optimism and with confidence in the leadership of the Royal Government, which we believe will bring the country’s situation back to normal.

Vattanac Bank will continue to properly implement its strategic plans to ensure convenient, safe and easy banking services. Meanwhile, we will continue to develop and improve our Digital Banking products—mobile banking, internet banking and cards. We will also strengthen our partnerships with the General Department of Taxation, General Department of Customs and Excise, Dai-ichi Life Insurance Cambodia and other institutions and businesses.

We plan to open 7 new Provincial branches in 2021, in line with our goal to establish presence in all the Provinces in Cambodia by 2022. There will be increased focus on staffing and training in all areas. We will also continue to provide opportunities to qualified candidates who desire to join us.

# Acknowledgements

We are thankful to the Royal Government of Cambodia for actively and promptly handling the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the banking industry.

We also thank our regulator, the National Bank of Cambodia, for the continued guidance provided, and for its timely relief measures for loan customers and allowing loan restructuring as an appropriate response to manage the negative impact of the pandemic.

We extend our appreciation and admiration to our shareholders and Board of Directors for their full support and confidence in expanding the Bank’s branch network expansion, as well as providing us with the direction and good recommendations to achieve the Bank’s sustainable business growth.

# Audited Financial Statements

## Loans and advances
Before the financial statements of the Bank were prepared, the Directors took reasonable steps to ascertain that actions had been taken in relation to the writing off of any bad loans and advances and the making of allowance for doubtful loans and advances, and had satisfied themselves that all known bad loans and advances had been written off and adequate allowance had been made for doubtful loans and advances.

At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances, which would render the amount written off for bad loans and advances, or the amount of allowance for doubtful loans and advances in the financial statements of the Bank, inadequate to any material extent.

## Current assets
Before the financial statements of the Bank were prepared, the Directors took reasonable steps to ensure that any current assets, other than loans and advances, which were unlikely to be realised in the ordinary course of business at their value as shown in the accounting records of the Bank had been written down to an amount which they might be expected to realise.

At the date of this report, the management is not aware of any circumstances, which would render the values attributed to the current assets in the financial statements of the Bank misleading.

## Valuation methods
At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances which have arisen which render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets and liabilities in the financial statements of the Bank misleading or inappropriate.

## Contingent and other liabilities
At the date of this report, there does not exist:
(a) any charge on the assets of the Bank which has arisen since the end of the financial year which secures the liabilities of any other person, or
(b) any contingent liability in respect of the Bank that has arisen since the end of the financial year other than in the ordinary course of banking business.

No contingent or other liability of the Bank has become enforceable, or is likely to become enforceable within the period of twelve months after the end of the financial year which, in the opinion of the Directors, will or may substantially affect the ability of the Bank to meet its obligations as and when they fall due.

## Change of circumstances
At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances, not otherwise dealt with in this report or the financial statements of the Bank, which would render any amount stated in the financial statements misleading.

## Items of material and unusual nature
The results of the operations of the Bank for the financial year were not, in the opinion of the Directors, substantially affected by any item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature except for:

## Coronavirus and impact on ECL
The ECL was estimated based on a range of forecast economic conditions as at reporting date. The Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak has spread across the world including Cambodia, causing disruption to business and economic activity. The impact on GDP and other
---
# key indicators has been considered when determining the severity and likelihood of downside economic scenarios that are used to estimate ECL in which the calculation of the ECL in this current environment is subject to significant uncertainty. Management provides its best estimate on the possible outcomes of Covid-19 on the Bank, however, this estimate may move materially as events unfold.

There has not arisen in the interval between the end of the financial year and the date of this report any item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature likely, in the opinion of the Directors, to affect substantially the results of the operations of the Bank for the current period in which this report is made.

During and at the end of the financial year, no arrangements existed to which the Bank is a party with the object of enabling Directors of the Bank to acquire benefits by means of the acquisition of shares in or debentures of the Bank or any other body corporate.

During the financial year, no Director of the Bank has received or become entitled to receive any benefit (other than a benefit included in the aggregate amount of emoluments received or due and receivable by the Directors as disclosed in the financial statements) by reason of a contract made by the Bank or a related corporation with a firm of which the Director is a member, or with a company in which the Director has a substantial financial interest other than as disclosed in the financial statements.

# Directors' responsibility in respect of the financial statements

The Directors are responsible for ascertaining that the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bank as at 31 December 2020, and its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:

(i) adopt appropriate accounting policies which are supported by reasonable and prudent judgments and estimates and then apply them consistently;

(ii) comply with Cambodian International Financial Reporting Standards (“CIFRSs”) or, if there have been any departures in the interest of true and fair presentation, ensure that these have been appropriately disclosed, explained and quantified in the financial statements;

(iii) oversee the Bank’s financial reporting process and maintain adequate accounting records and an effective system of internal controls;

(iv) assess the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intend to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so; and

(v) effectively control and direct effectively the Bank in all material decisions affecting the operations and performance and ascertain that such have been properly reflected in the financial statements.

The Board of Directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.

# Report of the Independent Auditors
## To the shareholders of Vattanac Bank

### Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Vattanac Bank (“the Bank”), which comprise the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2020, the statements of profit or loss and other
---
# Audited Financial Statements

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.

## Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with CISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with CISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

# Audited Financial Statements

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

# Notes to the Financial Statements

For the year ended 31 December 2020

## 1. Reporting entity

Vattanac Bank (the “Bank”) was incorporated in Cambodia on 1 July 2002 as a public limited company under the Registration No. 00006065 (formerly Co. 6000/02P). The Bank obtained a license from the National Bank of Cambodia (“NBC”) to operate as a commercial bank with effect from 7 June 2002 and officially commenced its operations on 8 November 2002.

The principal activities of the Bank comprise the operations of core banking business and the provision of related financial services through its head office and other branches in Cambodia. There were no changes in the nature of these principal activities during the year.

The registered office of the Bank is currently located at No. 66, Preah Monivong Boulevard, Sangkat Wat Phnom, Khan Daun Penh, Phnom Penh, Kingdom of Cambodia.

As at 31 December 2020, the Bank had 643 employees (31 December 2019: 532 employees).

## 2. Basis of accounting

The financial statements of the Bank have been prepared in accordance with the Cambodian International Financial Reporting Standards (“CIFRSs”).

Details of the Bank’s accounting policies are included in Note 34.

The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Bank’s Directors on 17 March 2021.

## 3. Functional and presentation currency

The Bank transacts its business and maintains its accounting records in United States Dollars (“US$”). Management has determined the US$ to be the Bank’s functional and presentation currency as it reflects the economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances of the Bank.

These financial statements are presented in US$, which is the Bank’s functional currency. All amounts have been rounded to the nearest dollar, except when otherwise indicated.

## 4. Use of judgments and estimates

In preparing these financial statements, management has made judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Bank’s accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.

Information about judgements made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is included in the following notes.

- Note 34(c)(ii): classification of financial assets: assessment of the business model within which the assets are held and assessment of whether the contractual terms of the financial asset are SPPI on the principal amount outstanding.
- Note 34(c)(vii): establishing the criteria for determining
---
# Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties

Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the year ended 31 December 2020 are included in the following notes:

- **Note 34(c)(vi):** determination of the fair value of financial instruments with significant unobservable inputs.
- **Note 34(c)(vii):** impairment of financial instruments: determining inputs into the ECL measurement model, including incorporation of forward-looking information.
- **Note 34(c)(viii):** impairment of financial instruments: key assumptions used in estimating recoverable cash flows.

# 5. Translation of United States Dollars into Khmer Riel

The financial statements are expressed in United States Dollars. The translations of United States Dollars amount into Khmer Riel are included solely for compliance with the Law on Accounting and Auditing.

Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate as at the reporting date. Share capital is translated at the historical rate. The statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and cash flows are translated into KHR using the average rate for the year. Exchange differences arising from the translation are recognised as “Currency translation reserves” in the other comprehensive income.

The Bank uses the following exchange rates:

|                        | Closing rate | Average rate |
|------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| 31 December 2020       | US$1 = KHR 4,045 | KHR 4,077 |
| 31 December 2019       | US$1 = KHR 4,075 | KHR 4,052 |

These convenient translations should not be construed as representations that the United States Dollars amounts have been, could have been, or could in the future be, converted into Khmer Riels at this or any other rate of exchange.

## A. Statutory capital deposit

Under the NBC’s Prakas No. B7-01-136 dated 15 October 2001, the Bank is required to maintain a statutory deposit 10% of its registered capital. This deposit is not available for use in the Bank’s day-to-day operations and is refundable should the Bank voluntarily cease its operations in Cambodia.

## B. Reserve requirements on customers’ deposits

The reserve requirements represent the minimum reserve which is calculated at 8% for KHR and 12.50% for other currencies of the total amount of deposits from customers, non-residential banks and financial institution deposits, and non-residential borrowings. Pursuant to the National Bank of Cambodia’s Prakas No. B7-018-282 on the maintenance of reserve requirements against commercial banks’ deposits and borrowings, reserve requirements both in KHR and in other currencies bear no interest effective from 29 August 2018.

On 17 March 2020, the NBC announced the reduction of the Reserve Requirements Rate (“RRR”) to 7% for both local and foreign currencies deposits and borrowings in order to help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Cambodia’s economy.

This represents provision for seniority indemnity payments required by Prakas No. 443 issued by the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training ("MoLVT") on 21 September 2018, and subsequently amended by the Instruction No. 042/19 dated 22 March 2019. It requires all employers to settle the seniority indemnity to their employee as follows:

- **Current pay**: starting from 2019 onwards at the amounts equal to 15 days of wages and other benefits per year.
- **Retrospective (back-pay)**: starting from end of 2021 onwards at the amounts equal to 6 days of net wages per year. The provision of back-pay seniority indemnity is calculated at a maximum amount of 6 months net wages (depends on the length of the service employee served) to the employee who has seniority before 2019.

On 2 June 2020, the MoLVT issued Prakas No. 018/20 for the postponement of seniority indemnity back-pay for periods before 2019 and postponement of seniority payments in 2020. Under this new measure, both the issuance of seniority indemnity back-pay for periods before 2019, and the issuance of seniority payments for 2020, have been delayed until 2022.

Payments will be made twice a year, in June and December respectively. Employees are not entitled to the remaining back-pay seniority indemnity which is not yet due, if he/she resigns from the Bank.

# 32. Financial risk management

## A. Introduction and overview

The Bank has exposure to the following risks from financial instruments:
- credit risk;
- market risk;
- liquidity risk; and
- operational risk

This note presents information about the Bank’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Bank’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Bank’s management of capital.

For the purpose of preserving the financial stability and reduce the burden of the borrowers who are losing their primary incomes and facing difficulties in repayment during the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank works constructively with affected borrowers and allows for loan restructuring. Loan restructuring is carried out by the Bank’s special unit that is independent from the lending department. This special unit shall regularly conduct a portfolio review of affected borrowers to measure the impact on their financial conditions during the pandemic.

## Risk management functional and governance structure

The Bank does not use derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange contract and interest rate swaps to manage its risk exposures.

The Directors have overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Bank’s risk management. The Directors have established the Audit Committee, Risk Management and Compliance Committee and New Activities and Products Committee which are responsible for developing and monitoring Bank risk management policies in their specified areas. All Board committees have both executive and non-executive members and report regularly to the Directors on their activities.

The Risk Management and Compliance Committee was established to assist the Directors in its role and responsibilities over risk management and compliance of the Bank relating to risks in business operations and risk monitoring process. These include risk identification, risk management, risk monitoring and effective compliance with laws and regulations in accordance with the Bank’s risk management policies approved by the Directors. The Risk Management and Compliance Department plays an important role on a day-to-day basis in assisting the Risk Management and Compliance Committee to monitor the potential risks associated with the operations of the Bank and its branches and compliance controls of the Bank to meet the requirements of laws and regulations including laws and Prakas on Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism set out by the NBC.

The Audit Committee is assisted in these functions by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad-hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee. In addition, the Audit Committee monitors and evaluates the efficiency of the management structure, policies and procedures, activities and operations of the Bank as well as compliance with laws and regulations.
---
# 32. Financial risk management (continued)

The New Activities and Products Committee was established to assist the Directors to ensure that policies, charters and guidelines are in place in order to assess, evaluate and mitigate the risks pertaining to new products/new activities to be introduced.

## B. Credit risk

‘Credit risk’ is the risk of financial loss to the Bank if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Bank’s loans and advances to customers and other banks, and investment debt securities. For risk management reporting purposes, the Bank considers and consolidates all elements of credit risk exposure – e.g. individual obligor default risk, country and sector risk.

### B. Credit risk (continued)

Credit risk is the potential loss of revenue and principal losses arising mainly from loans and advances and loan commitments as a result of default by the borrowers or counterparties through its lending activities.

#### (i). Management of credit risk

The lending activities are guided by the Bank’s credit policy to ensure that the overall objectives in the area of lending are achieved; i.e., that the loan portfolio is strong and healthy, and credit risks are well diversified. The credit policy documents the lending policy, collateral policy and credit approval processes, including the Bank’s own internal credit risk rating system, and procedures implemented to ensure compliance with NBC Guidelines.

The Bank has established the Core Credit Risk Policy which is designed to govern the Bank’s risk undertaking activities. Extension of credit is governed by credit programs that set out the plan for a particular product or portfolio, including the target market, terms and conditions, documentation and procedures under which a credit product will be offered and measured.

Credit risk ratings are reviewed and updated on an annual basis, and in events of (i) change of loan terms and conditions including extension; (ii) repayment irregularities or delinquencies and (iii) adverse information relating to the borrower or transaction.

#### (ii). Risk limit control and mitigation policies

The Bank employs a range of policies and practices to mitigate credit risk. The most traditional of these is the taking of security in the form of collateral for loans to customers, which is common practice. The Bank implements guidelines on the acceptability of specific classes of collateral. The principal collateral types to secure for loans to customers are:

- Hypothec/mortgages over residential and business properties (land, buildings and other properties); and
- Cash in the form of fixed and margin deposits.

#### (iii). Concentration of risk

The Directors created the Bank Credit Committee for the oversight of credit risk. A separate Bank Credit department, reporting to the Bank Credit Committee, is responsible for managing the Bank’s credit risk, including the following.
---
# Audited Financial Statements

The following table presents the Bank’s maximum exposure to credit risk of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments, without taking into account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements. For on-balance sheet assets, the exposure to credit risk equals their carrying amount. For contingent liabilities, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount that the Bank would have to pay if the obligations of the instruments issued are called upon. For credit commitments, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the full amount of the undrawn credit facilities granted to customers.

## Type of credit exposure

(*) A "large exposure" is defined under the NBC's Prakas as the overall gross exposure of the aggregate balance of loans and advances with one single beneficiary, which exceeds 10% of the Bank's net worth. The exposure is the higher of the outstanding loans or commitments and the authorised loans or commitments.

(**) A "restructured loan" is a loan that original contractual terms have been modified to provide for concessions for the borrowers for reasons related to real temporary financial difficulties.

## Audited Financial Statements

### (iv). Collateral

Whilst the Bank’s maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount of the assets or, in the case of off-balance sheet instruments, the amount guaranteed, committed, accepted or endorsed, the likely exposure may be lower due to offsetting collateral, credit guarantees and other actions taken to mitigate the Bank’s exposure.

The description of collateral for each class of financial asset is set out below.

### B. Credit risk (continued)

#### (iv). Collateral (continued)

**Cash equivalents with other banks, placements with other banks, debt investments and other assets**

Collateral is generally not sought for these assets.

**Loans and advances to customers, contingent liabilities and commitments**

Certain Loans and advances to customers, contingent liabilities and commitments are typically collateralised to a substantial extent. In particular, residential mortgage exposures are generally fully secured by residential properties.

The table below summarises the Bank’s security coverage of its financial assets:

## (v). Credit quality of gross loans and advances to customers

From 27 March 2020, the Bank has applied Circular No. B7-020-001 issued by the NBC on loan restructuring to support customers affected by COVID-19 by:

- reducing the amount of loan principal or amount to be repaid at the maturity;
- lowering interest rate than original contractual terms;
- deferring the repayment of principal or interest or capitalised interest;
- extending the maturity date; adding and/or modifying co-borrower and/or guarantor, when applicable;
- changing an instalment loan to an interest payment only where the principal is repaid at the maturity (bullet loan);
- releasing collaterals or accepting lower level of collateralisation; and
- easing of covenants or/and providing grace period for repayment up to 6 months from the effective signing date of the new contract.
---

# 32. Financial risk management (continued)
## B. Credit risk (continued)
### (v). Credit quality of gross loans and advances to customers (continued)

Accordingly, for customers who paid principle payment or interest, or both payments not past due more than 90 days (performing loan) and are expected to be experiencing only temporary financial and repayment difficulties. NBC allows loan restructuring to all sectors impacted by COVID-19 pandemic and floods based on the Bank’s own valuation.

Pursuant to the NBC guideline Prakas B7-017-344, it has defined each credit grading according to its credit quality as follows:

#### Normal:
Outstanding facility is repaid on timely manner and is not in doubt for the future repayment. Repayment is steadily made according with the contractual terms and the facility does not exhibit any potential weakness in repayment capability, business, cash flow and financial position of the counterparty.

#### Special Mention:
A facility in this class is currently protected and may not be past due but it exhibits potential weaknesses that may adversely affect repayment of the counterparty at the future date, if not corrected in a timely manner, and close attention by the Institution.

Weaknesses include but are not limited to a declining trend in the business operations of the counterparty or in its financial position, and adverse economic and market conditions that all might affect its profitability and its future repayment capacity or deteriorating conditions on the collateral. This class has clearly its own rational and should not be used as a compromise between Normal and Substandard.

#### Substandard
A facility ranked in this class exhibits noticeable weakness and is not adequately protected by the current business or financial position and repayment capacity of the counterparty. In essence, the primary source of repayment is not sufficient to service the debt, not taking into account the income from secondary sources such as the realization of the collateral.

Factors leading to a substandard classification include:
- Inability of the counterparty to meet the contractual repayments’ terms,
- Unfavourable economic and market conditions that would adversely affect the business and profitability of the counterparty in the future,
- Weakened financial condition and/or inability of the counterparty to generate enough cash flow to service the payments,
- Difficulties experienced by the counterparty in repaying other facilities granted by the Institution or by other institutions when the information is available, and
- Breach of financial covenants by the counterparty.

---
# Doubtful

A facility classified in this category exhibits more severe weaknesses than one classified Substandard such that its full collection on the basis of existing facts, conditions or collateral value is highly questionable or improbable. The prospect of loss is high, even if the exact amount remains undetermined for now.

# Loss

A facility is classified Loss when it is not collectable, and little or nothing can be done to recover the outstanding amount from the counterparty.

# Recognition of ECL

The Bank apply a three-stage approach based on the change in credit quality since initial recognition:

| 3-Stage approach | Stage 1 | Stage 2 | Stage 3 |
|------------------|---------|---------|---------|
| **Recognition of expected credit losses** | 12 months expected credit losses | Lifetime expected credit losses | Lifetime expected credit losses |
| **Criterion** | No significant increase in credit risk | Credit risk increased significantly | Credit impaired assets |
| **Basic of calculation of profit revenue** | On gross carrying amount | On gross carrying amount | On net carrying amount |

The Bank will measure ECL by using the general approach. The general approach consists of segregating the customers into three different stages according to the staging criteria by assessing the credit risk. 12-month ECL will be computed for stage 1, while lifetime ECL will be computed for stage 2 and stage 3. At each reporting date, the Bank will assess credit risk of each account as compared to the risk level at origination date.

|        |                                             | Loss           | DPD ≥ 91        | Nonperforming     |

The Bank will use the day past due (DPD) information and NBC’s classification for staging criteria. Also, the Bank will incorporate credit scoring or more forward looking elements in the future when information is more readily available.

As for financial assets that are short term in nature, simplified approach will be adopted where no staging criteria is required. In this case, it will be either performing (stage1) or non-performing.

#### Incorporation of forward-looking information

The Bank incorporates forward-looking information into both the assessment of whether the credit risk of an instrument has increased significantly since its initial recognition and the measurement of ECL.

External information considered includes economic data and forecasts published by governmental bodies and monetary authorities in the countries where the Bank operates, supranational organisations such as the World Bank, and selected private-sector and academic forecasters.

The Bank used the macroeconomic historical data is being taken from the World Bank published data. In order to forecast the probability of default for future years, the known quarterly Observed Default Rates ("ODRs") are regressed against the quarterly macro-economic variables ("MEV") values. The Bank has used a time weighted average methodology in order to forecast future MEVs. A forward-looking scalar is computed as the ratio of the ODR based on the most recently known MEV and the forecasted MEV.

The MEVs are shocked in order to generate base, best- and worst-case scenarios. This has been done by computing the standard deviation of the known historical values of the MEV and adjusting the base value by +/- 1 standard deviation to generate best- and worst-case scenarios.

The Bank has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for each portfolio of financial instruments in accordance with each country and, using an analysis of historical data, has estimated relationships between macro-economic variables and credit risk and credit losses.

#### COVID-19 Outbreak and Impact on ECL

In response to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank has determined that the economic outlook for the upcoming years is highly impacted by the pandemic and therefore sets forth of new set of economic (and loss) scenarios accordingly.

The Bank has revised its economic forecasts used as an input into ECL as at 31 December 2020 down from 2019. The Bank believes that the adjustment reflects more recent economic conditions.

For the purpose of ECL computation, to reflect the current climate, the Bank has taken into account the stressed economic scenarios during this COVID-19 pandemic by revisiting its probability-weighted outcome (PWO) and putting higher weight on the worst-case scenario and lesser weight on the best-case scenario. The Bank's Management has already adjusted probability weightage by stressing more weight on worse-case scenario to 40% (2019: 33%) and lessening weight of best-case scenario to only 25% (2019: 33%).

The table below show the scenario probability weighted percentage as at 31 December 2019 (pre-COVID 19 pandemic) and as at 31 December 2020 (post COVID-19 pandemic).

| Scenario | 31 December 2019 | 31 December 2020 |
|----------|------------------|------------------|
| Best-case scenario | 33% | 25% |
| Worst-case scenario | 33% | 40% |

## D. Liquidity risk

'Liquidity risk' is the risk that the Bank will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Liquidity risk arises from mismatches in the timing and amounts of cash flows, which is inherent to the Bank's operations and investments.

### Management of liquidity risk

The Bank manages its liquidity through its Asset Liability Management Committee which is responsible for establishing the liquidity policy as well as monitoring liquidity on an ongoing basis. A Minimum Liquid Asset requirement has been established to ensure that the ratio of liquid assets to qualifying liabilities is subject to a minimum threshold at all times.

The table below summarises the Bank's assets and liabilities based on remaining contractual maturities. The expected cash flows of these assets and liabilities could vary significantly from what is shown in the table. For example, deposits from customers are not all expected to be withdrawn immediately.

# 32. Financial risk management (continued)

### E. Operational risk

The operational risk is the risk of losses arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems or from external factors. This risk is managed through established operational risk management processes, proper monitoring and reporting of the business activities by control and oversight provided by the senior Management. This includes legal, compliance, accounting and fraud risk.

The operational risk management entails the establishment of clear organizational structures, roles and control policies. Various internal control policies and measures have been implemented. These include the establishment of signing authorities, defining system parameters controls, streaming procedures and documentation ensuring compliance with regulatory and legal requirements. These are reviewed continually to address the operational risks of its banking business.

### F. Capital management

#### (i). Regulatory capital

The Bank’s objectives when managing capital, which is a broader concept than the “equity” on the face of the statement of financial position, are:

- To comply with the capital requirements set by the NBC;
- To safeguard the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders; and
- To maintain a strong capital base to support the development of the business.

The Bank’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain market confidence and to sustain further development of the business. The impact of the level of capital on shareholders’ return is also recognised and the Bank recognised the need to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with greater gearing and advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.

#### (ii). Capital allocation

The allocation of capital between specific operations and activities is, to a large extent, driven by optimisation of the return achieved on the capital allocated. The amount of capital allocated to each operation or activity is based primarily upon the regulatory capital.

# 33. Fair values of financial assets and liabilities

Financial instruments comprise financial assets, financial liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Bank has access at that date. The information presented herein represents the estimates of fair values as at the financial position date.

Quoted and observable market prices, where available, are used as the measure of fair values of the financial instruments. Where such quoted and observable market prices are not available, fair values are estimated based on a range of methodologies and assumptions regarding risk.
---
# Fair Value Information

Characteristics of various financial instruments, discount rates, estimates of future cash flows and other factors.

Fair value information for non-financial assets and liabilities are excluded as they do not fall within the scope of CIFRS 7: Financial Instruments Disclosures which requires the fair value information to be disclosed. These include investment in subsidiaries and property and equipment.

The fair value of the Bank’s financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalent, placement with other banks, debt investments, deposits from customers and banks, other assets, borrowing and other liabilities are not materially sensitive to shifts in market profit rate because of the limited term to maturity of these instruments. As such, the carrying value of these financial assets and liabilities at financial position date approximate their fair values.

The fair values are based on the following methodologies and assumptions:

## Investments

The estimated fair values are generally based on quoted and observable market prices. Where there is no ready market in certain securities, fair values have been estimated by reference to market indicative yields or net tangible asset backing of the investee.

## Financing, advances and others

The fair value is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using the prevailing market rates of financing with similar credit risks and maturities.

## Fair Value Hierarchy

CIFRS 7 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources and unobservable inputs reflect the Bank’s market assumptions. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:

- **Level 1** – Quoted price (unadjusted) in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities. This level includes listed equity securities and debt instruments.
- **Level 2** – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices).
- **Level 3** – Inputs for asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). This level includes equity instruments and debt instruments with significant unobservable components.

The Bank’s financial assets and liability are not measured at fair value. As verifiable market prices are not available, market prices are not available for a significant proportion of the Bank’s financial assets and liabilities, the fair values, therefore, have been based on management assumptions according to the profile of the asset and liability base. In the opinion of the management, the carrying amounts of the financial assets and liabilities included in the balance sheet are a reasonable estimation of their fair values.
---

# 34. Significant accounting policies

### A. Basis of measurement
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis.

### B. Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of at the spot exchange rates at the date of the transactions.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate at the reporting date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between the amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the year, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the year, and the amortised cost in the foreign currency translated at the spot exchange rate at the end of the year.

Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate at the date on which the fair value is determined. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

### C. Financial assets and financial liabilities
#### (i) Recognition and initial measurement
The Bank initially recognises loans and advances, and debt investments on the date on which they are originated. All other financial the date on which the Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset or financial liability is measured initially at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue.

#### (ii) Classification
##### Financial assets
On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost, FVOCI or FVTPL.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:
- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:
- the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.

All other financial assets are classified as measured at FVTPL.

In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may

# Business model assessment

The Bank makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered includes:

- the stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In particular, whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual interest revenue, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- how the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Bank’s management;
- the risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and its strategy for how those risks are managed;
- how managers of the business are compensated (e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected); and
- the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

# Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as profit margin.

In making the assessment, the Bank considers:

- contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;
- leverage features;
- prepayment and extension terms;
- terms that limit the Bank’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse loans); and
- features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates).
---
# Non-recourse loans

In some cases, loans made by the Bank that are secured by collateral of the borrower limit the Bank’s claim to cash flows of the underlying collateral (non-recourse loans). The Bank applies judgment in assessing whether the non-recourse loans meet the SPPI criterion. The Bank typically considers the following information when making this judgement:

- whether the contractual arrangement specifically defines the amounts and dates of the cash payments of the loan;
- the fair value of the collateral relative to the amount of the secured financial asset;
- the ability and willingness of the borrower to make contractual payments, notwithstanding a decline in the value of collateral;
- whether the borrower is an individual or a substantive operating entity or is a special-purpose entity;
- the Bank’s risk of loss on the asset relative to a full-recourse loan;
- the extent to which the collateral represents all or a substantial portion of the borrower’s assets; and
- whether the Bank will benefit from any upside from the underlying assets.

# Reclassifications

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Bank changes its business model for managing financial assets.

## (iii). Derecognition

### Financial assets

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of (i) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI is recognised in profit and loss.

### Financial liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expire.

## (iv). Modifications of financial assets and financial liabilities

### Financial assets

If the terms of a financial asset are modified, then the Bank evaluates whether the cash flows of the modified asset are substantially different.

If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised (see (iii)) and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modification are accounted for as follows:

- fees that are considered in determining the fair
---
# Audited Financial Statements

value of the new asset and fees that represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the asset; and

- other fees are included in profit and loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition.
- If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the Bank plan to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place (see below for write-off policy). This approach impacts the result of the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.
- If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the Bank first recalculate the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognise the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit and loss. For floating-rate financial assets, the original effective interest rate used to calculate the modification gain or loss is adjusted to reflect current market terms at the time of the modification. Any costs or fees incurred and fees received as part of the modification adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.
- If such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower, then the gain or loss is presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it is presented as interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method.

## Financial liabilities

- The Bank derecognise a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and consideration paid is recognised in profit and loss. Consideration paid includes non-financial assets transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability.
- If the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost of the liability is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit and loss. For floating-rate financial liabilities, the original effective interest rate used to calculate the modification gain or loss is adjusted to reflect current market terms at the time of the modification. Any costs and fees incurred are recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial liability by re-computing the effective interest rate on the instrument.
---
# (v). Offsetting
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Bank has a legal right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

# (vi). Fair value measurement
‘Fair value’ is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Bank has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.

When one is available, the Bank measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as ‘active’ if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Bank uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction.

The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price – i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the Bank determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique for which any unobservable inputs are judged to be insignificant in relation to the measurement, then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognised in profit and loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed out.

If an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price, then the Bank measures assets and long positions at a bid price and liabilities and short positions at an ask price.

Portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities that are exposed to market risk and credit risk that are managed by the Bank on the basis of the net exposure to either market or credit risk are measured on the basis of a price that would be received to sell a net long position (or paid to transfer a net short position) for the particular risk exposure. Portfolio-level adjustments – e.g. bid-ask adjustment or credit risk adjustments that reflect the measurement on the basis of the net exposure – are allocated to the individual assets and liabilities on the basis of the relative risk adjustment of each of the individual instruments in the portfolio.

The fair value of a financial liability with a demand feature (e.g. a demand deposit) is not less than the amount payable on demand, discounted from the first date on which the amount could be required to be paid.

# Audited Financial Statements

The Bank recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.

### (vii). Impairment

The Bank recognises loss allowances for ECL on the following financial instruments that are not measured at FVTPL:

- financial assets that are debt instruments; and
- loan commitments issued.

No impairment loss is recognised on equity investments.

The Bank measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, except for the following, for which they are measured as 12-month ECL:

- debt investments that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and
- other financial instruments (other than lease receivables) on which credit risk has not increased significantly since their initial recognition.

12-month ECL are the portion of ECL that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date. Financial instruments for which a 12-month ECL is recognised are referred to as 'Stage 1 financial instruments'.

Lifetime ECL are the ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument. Financial instruments for which a lifetime ECL is recognised but which are not credit-impaired are referred to as 'Stage 2 financial instruments'.

At each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition. When credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.

When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Bank considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Bank’s historical experience and informed credit assessment and includes forward-looking information.

If credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition or if the credit quality of the financial instruments improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs.

The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Bank is exposed to credit risk.

**Determining whether credit risk has increased significantly**

The Bank assesses whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition at each reporting date. Determining whether an increase in credit risk is significant depends on the characteristics of the financial instrument and the borrower, and the geographical region.

---
# ANNUAL REPORT 2020

## Audited Financial Statements

The Bank considers that a significant increase in credit risk occurs no later than when an asset is more than 30 days past due. Days past due are determined by counting the number of days since the earliest elapsed due date in respect of which full payment has not been received. Due dates are determined without considering any grace period that might be available to the borrower.

If there is evidence that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk relative to initial recognition, then the loss allowance on an instrument returns to being measured as 12-month ECL.

### Definition of default

The Bank considers a financial asset to be in default when:

- The borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank in full, without recourse by the Bank to actions such as realising security (if any is held); or
- The Bank considers that a significant increase in credit risk occurs no later than when an asset is more than or equal to 30 days past due for long-term facilities or more than or equal to 15 days past due for short-term facilities.

### Measurement of ECL

ECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. They are measured as follows:

- Financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive);
- Financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the difference between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows; and
- Undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Bank if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive.

### Inputs, assumptions and techniques used for estimating impairment

The key inputs into the measurement of ECL are the term structure of the following variables:

- Probability of default ("PD");
- Loss given default ("LGD"); and
- Exposure at default ("EAD").

ECL for exposures in Stage 1 is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD by LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated by multiplying the lifetime PD by LGD and EAD.

The statistical model has been employed to analyse data collected and generate estimate of remaining lifetime PD of exposure and how these are expected to change as result of passage of time.

LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Bank estimates LGD parameters by benchmarking the value using BASEL IRBF parameter set at 45% and 30% for senior claims on corporates, sovereigns and banks.

EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Bank derives the EAD from the current
---

# Audited Financial Statements

exposure to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract and arising from amortisation. The EAD of a financial asset is its gross carrying amount at the time of default. For lending commitments, the EADs are potential future amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are estimated based on historical observations and forward-looking forecasts. For some financial assets, EAD is determined by modelling the range of possible exposure outcomes at various points in time using scenario and statistical techniques.

As described above, and subject to using a maximum of a 12-month PD for Stage 1 financial assets, the Bank measures ECL considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period (including any borrower’s extension options) over which it is exposed to credit risk, even if, for credit risk management purposes, the Bank considers a longer period. The maximum contractual period extends to the date at which the Bank has the right to require repayment of an advance or terminate a loan commitment or guarantee.

## Restructured financial assets

If the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made of whether the financial asset should be derecognised and ECL are measured as follows.

- If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing asset.
- If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset.

## Credit-impaired financial assets

At each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt financial assets carried at FVOCI are credit-impaired (referred to as ‘Stage 3 financial assets’). A financial asset is ‘credit-impaired’ when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
- the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Bank on terms that the Bank would not consider otherwise;
- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or
- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.

# ANNUAL REPORT 2020

## Audited Financial Statements

A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower's condition is usually considered to be credit-impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a loan that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different.

### Presentation of allowance for ECL in the statement of financial position

Loss allowances for ECL are presented in the statement of financial position for financial assets measured at amortised cost: as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets.

Allowance for financial guarantee contracts are presented in a separate liability in the statement of financial position.

### Write-off

Loans and advances are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Bank determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the individual asset level.

Recoveries of amounts previously written off are generally included in ‘impairment losses on financial instruments’ in the statement of profit and loss and OCI.

In the event such recoveries are material, a separate line item will be included in “other income”.

Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Bank’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

### D. Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and bank balances, demand deposits and short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased, and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

Cash equivalents with other banks are receivable on demand or on short notice and are classified as amortised cost in the statement of financial position. The cash and cash equivalents are held with bank and financial institution counterparties, which are rated AA- to AA+, based on Standard & Poor’s MOODY and Bloomberg ratings.

### E. Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of the ordinary share are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects. Other shares are classified as equity and/or liability according to the economic substance of the particular instrument. Distributions to holders of a financial instrument classified as an equity instrument are charged directly to equity.

# F. Regulatory reserves

Regulatory reserves are set up for the variance of provision between loan impairment in accordance with CIFRS and regulatory provision in accordance with National Bank of Cambodia’s Prakas No. B7-017-344 dated 1 December 2017 and Circular No. B7-018-001 Sor Ror Chor Nor dated 16 February 2018 on credit risk classification and provision on impairment for banks and financial institutions. In accordance with Article 73, the entity shall compare the provision calculated in accordance with Article 49 to 71 and the provision calculated in accordance with Article 72, and the record:

1. In case that the regulatory provision calculated in accordance with Article 72 is lower than provision calculated in accordance with Article 49 to 71, the entity records the provision calculated in accordance with CIFRS; and
2. In case that the regulatory provision calculated in accordance with Article 72 is higher than provision calculated in accordance with Article 49 to 71, the entity records the provision calculated in accordance with CIFRS and transfer the difference from retained earnings or accumulated loss account into regulatory reserves in shareholders’ equity account.

The regulatory reserves are not an item to be included in the calculation of the Institution net worth.

# G. Placements with other banks

Placements with other banks are stated at amortised cost less impairment for any uncollectable amounts.

# H. Statutory deposits

Statutory deposits are stated at cost and included balances with the NBC are maintained in compliance with the Cambodian Law on Banking and Financial Institutions and are determined by the defined percentage of the minimum share capital and the customers’ deposits as required by NBC.

# I. Loans and advances

‘Loans and advances’ captions in the statement of financial position include loans and advances measured at amortised cost; they are initially measured at fair value plus incremental direct transaction costs, and subsequently at their amortised cost using the effective interest method.

# J. Other assets

Other assets are carried at amortised cost less impairment if any.

# K. Property and equipment

## (i) Recognition and measurement

Items of property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.

## (i) Recognition and measurement (continued)

Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. The cost of
---

# ANNUAL REPORT 2020

## Audited Financial Statements

self-constructed assets also includes the cost of materials and direct labour. For qualifying assets, borrowing costs are capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy on borrowing costs. Cost also may include transfers from equity of any gain or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property and equipment.

Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.

When significant parts of an item of property and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property and equipment.

### (ii). Subsequent costs

The gain or loss on disposal of an item of property and equipment is determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property and equipment and is recognised net within “other income” and “other expenses” respectively in profit or loss.

The cost of replacing a component of an item of property and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Bank, and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced component is derecognised to profit or loss. The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

### (iii). Depreciation

Depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value. Significant components of individual assets are assessed, and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, then that component is depreciated separately.

Depreciation is recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a declining basis except for buildings which is depreciated on a straight-line basis.

Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Bank will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Freehold land is not depreciated.

Depreciation is recognised from the date that the property and equipment are installed and are ready for use, or in respect of internally constructed assets, from the date that the asset is completed and ready for use.

The estimated useful lives for the current period are as follows:

---
# Audited Financial Statements

|                          | Rate         |
|--------------------------|--------------|
| Buildings                | 5%           |
| Leasehold improvements   | 20%          |
| Furniture and fitting    | 25%          |
| Computers and office equipment | 25% - 50% |
| Motor vehicles           | 25%          |

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed at end of the reporting period and adjusted if appropriate.

## L. Intangible assets

Intangible assets, which comprise acquired computer software licenses and related costs, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment loss. Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised on the basis of the cost incurred to acquire the specific software and bring it to use.

Intangible assets are amortised on a declining balance method at a rate of 50% per annum.

Costs associated with the development or maintenance of computer software are recognised as expenses when incurred.

Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed at end of the reporting period and adjusted if appropriate.

## M. Leases

At inception of a contract, the Bank assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for period of time in exchange for consideration.

To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Bank assesses whether:
- the contract involves the use of an identified asset - this may be specified explicitly or implicitly, and should be physically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a substantive substitution right throughout the period of use, then the asset is not identified;
- the Bank has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use; and
- the Bank has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Bank has this right when it has the
---
# ANNUAL REPORT 2020

## Audited Financial Statements

decision-making rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used. In cases where all the decisions about how and for what purpose the asset is used are predetermined, the Bank has the right to direct the use of the asset if either:

- the Bank has the right to operate the asset; or
- the Bank designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose it will be used.

At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease and non-lease component, the Bank allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component and aggregate of non-lease components on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices. However, for the leases of land and buildings in which it is a lessee, the Bank has elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.

### Leases in which the Bank is a lessee

An arrangement conveyed the right to use the asset if one of the following was met:

- the purchaser had the ability or right to operate the asset while obtaining or controlling more than an insignificant amount of the output;
- the purchaser had the ability or right to control physical access to the asset while obtaining or controlling more than an insignificant amount of the output; or
- facts and circumstances indicated that it was remote that other parties would take more than an insignificant amount of the output, and the price per unit was neither fixed per unit of output nor equal to the current market price per unit of output.

The Bank recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The estimated useful lives for the current period are as follows:

- Building and office branches: 5 – 10 years

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, to the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Bank uses its
---
# Audited Financial Statements

incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:
- fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;
- variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;
- amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and
- the exercise price under a purchase option that the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Bank is reasonably certain not to terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in the lease term, a change in the assessment of the option to purchase the underlying asset, a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, or if there is a change in the Bank’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit and loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
The Bank has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases of machinery that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets, including IT equipment. The Bank recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

## N. Employee benefits

### (i) Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Bank has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

### (ii) Other long-term employee benefits
The Bank’s net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits is the amount of the benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Remeasurements are recognised in profit and loss in the period in which they arise.

## O. Provisions
Provisions are recognised in the statement of financial position when the Bank has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future

## P. Borrowing

Borrowing is initially measured at fair value minus incremental direct transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

## Q. Interest

### Effective interest rate

Interest income and expense are recognised in profit and loss using the effective interest method. The 'effective interest rate' is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to:

- the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or
- the amortised cost of the financial liability.

When calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments other than purchased or originated credit-impaired assets, the Bank estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not ECL. For purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, a credit-adjusted effective interest rate is calculated using estimated future cash flows including ECL.

The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability.

### Amortised cost and gross carrying amount

The 'amortised cost' of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance.

The 'gross carrying amount of a financial asset' is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.

### Calculation of interest income and expense

The effective interest rate of a financial asset or financial liability is calculated on initial recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability. In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. The effective interest rate is revised as a result of periodic re-estimation of cash flows of floating rate instruments to reflect cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost.

# Audited Financial Statements

movements in market rates of interest. The effective interest rate is also revised for fair value hedge adjustments at the date amortisation of the hedge adjustment begins.

However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.

For financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the asset. The calculation of interest income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves.

## Presentation

Interest income calculated using the effective interest method presented in the statement of profit and loss and OCI includes interest on financial assets and financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

Interest expense presented in the statement of profit and loss and OCI includes financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

## R. Fee and commission

Fee and commission income and expense that are integral to the effective interest rate on a financial asset or financial liability are included in the effective interest rate. Other fee and commission income – including account servicing fees is recognised as the related services are performed.

A contract with a customer that results in a recognised financial instrument in the Bank’s financial statements may be partially in the scope of CIFRS 9 and partially in the scope of CIFRS 15. If this is the case, then the Bank first applies CIFRS 9 to separate and measure the part of the contract that is in the scope of CIFRS 9 and then applies CIFRS 15 to the residual.

## 5. Impairment of non-financial assets

The carrying amounts of the Bank’s non-financial assets (other than deferred tax assets) are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.

For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.

Impairment losses are recognised in profit and loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are
---

# T. Income tax

Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognised in profit and loss except items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income.

The Bank has determined that interest and penalties related to income taxes, including uncertain tax treatments, do not meet the definition of income taxes, and therefore has accounted for them under CIAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and has recognised the related expenses in ‘other expenses’.

## (i). Current tax

Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income for the period using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous period.

## (ii). Deferred tax

Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.

A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow the manner in which the Bank expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.

---
# U. Contingent liabilities
Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is not recognised in the statements of financial position and is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote. Possible obligations, whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events, are also disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.

# V. Contingent assets
Where it is not possible that there is an inflow of economic benefits, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the asset is not recognised in the statements of financial position and is disclosed as a contingent asset, unless the probability of inflow of economic benefits is remote. Possible obligations, whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events, are also disclosed as contingent assets unless the probability of inflow of economic benefits is remote.

# 35. New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2020 and earlier application is permitted; however, the Bank has not early adopted the new or amended standards in preparing these financial statements.

The following amended standards and interpretations are not expected to have a significant impact on the Bank’s financial statements:

- COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions (Amendment to CIFRS 16);
- Onerous contracts – Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (Amendments to CIAS 37);
- Reference to Conceptual Framework (Amendments to CIFRS 3);
- Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to CIAS 16); and
- Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to CIAS 1).

# 36. Non-adjusting subsequent events
On 8 January 2021, the Board approved to distribute a dividend of US$10,000,000 to its shareholders in respect of the audited retained earnings as at 31 December 2019. The Bank has submitted the letter requesting for approval from the National Bank of Cambodia on the said dividend distribution.
