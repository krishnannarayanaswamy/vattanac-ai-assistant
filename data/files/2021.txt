# Statement to Stakeholders
## Message from Neak Oknha Chairman

![Chairman Image](image-url)

> "Only when we make ourselves stronger do we become resilient under any circumstances."
>
> Neak Oknha **SAM ANG**
> Chairman

Cambodia managed to record an economic growth of around 3% in 2021 despite experiencing an adverse economic and social impact caused by the more contagious Covid-19 variant in the early part of the year. The pandemic in Cambodia became less severe in late 2021 thanks to the community immunity brought about by the Royal Government’s effective vaccination campaign.

The extraordinary ordeal arising from the past two years’ economic and social crisis triggered by the pandemic left almost all businesses shocked and unprepared to respond. During this challenging time, maintaining business communities’ economic and financial stability was key to stabilizing the macro economy so that the government could run the country as it would normally.

As a bank serving Cambodian people with financial services for the past 19 years, Vattanac Bank has committed itself to actively contributing to seeking solutions for customers facing financial challenges to help maintain the country’s economic stability. We remained resolute in implementing our business strategy aligned with our mission and vision. The Bank will expand our branch network to all Cities and Provinces of Cambodia, investing more in digitalization, building more human resources, etc., to help reinforce resilience in Cambodia’s banking industry and maintain macroeconomic stability.

# 2022 Target

After the Covid-19 pandemic, Vattanac Bank has become more cognizant that

> "Only when we make ourselves stronger do we become resilient under any circumstances."

In this context, we have remained committed to making our planned investment both before and during the pandemic to increase our service quality and strengthen and expand our human resources and organizational structure. We have created a positive contribution to resolving social challenges by doing our utmost to help deal with the issues of our customers. With this experience, Vattanac Bank has no hesitation in making investments in the present and future to make ourselves stronger.

Cambodia is estimated to record a 5.4% economic growth in 2022 after resuming almost all economic activities when the Covid-19 pandemic becomes less severe due to a high vaccination rate of 96% among its population. It will provide a good opportunity for the private sector to recover from its impact. Trusting the Royal Government, Vattanac Bank’s Shareholders stay committed to future investments. Notably, in 2022, the Bank plans to achieve our key targets of providing better services for customers and expedite the planned expansion of our branch network to all Cities and Provinces to bring banking services closer to customers. In 2022, we plan to open 11 new branches:

- Mao Tse Toung Branch
- Kampot Branch
- Stung Treng Branch
- Krong Takhmao Branch
- Preah Monivong Branch
- Koh Kong Branch
- Krong Battambang Branch
- Snoul Branch
- Mondulkiri Branch
- Sihanoukville Branch, and
- Bavet Branch

We will also continue investing in more digital/technological infrastructure to make our digital banking services better, more intelligent, and more secure in tandem with the latest technological developments worldwide.

# Appreciation

Vattanac Bank would like to express our deepest gratitude to the Royal Government of Cambodia for providing encouragement and opportunities to the banking industry, especially during the prolonged Covid-19 pandemic.

At the same time, we would like to express our sincere thanks to the National Bank of Cambodia for facilitating and making recommendations to reinforce the resilience of the banking sector in Cambodia.

We want to express our sincere appreciation to our Shareholders for their support and trust in the Board of Directors’ leadership.

We appreciate the discipline, loyalty, commitment, hard work, and dedication of the Management and Staff of all levels. They worked together to implement our plans, including doing their best to help customers deal with their challenges in 2021. Vattanac Bank strongly hopes that Management and Staff will continue their excellent work and, with added vigor, perform their roles and duties to bring greater success to Vattanac Bank in the coming years.

Lastly, we would like to thank our customers and partners for their loyal support, confidence, and trust in Vattanac Bank. We look forward to their continued partnership with Vattanac Bank.

# Message from Neak Oknha President

![Neak Oknha President](image.jpg)

> "Think together, Work together for our common interest."
> 
> Neak Oknha CHHUN LEANG
> President

In this challenging year, Vattanac Bank, fully supported by all the Shareholders and guided by the Board of Directors, continued to focus on the financial stability of all stakeholders, including customers, staff, and the Bank. We worked together on numerous tasks to minimize the impact and maximize our progress under the concept: We think together, we work together and solve problems together.

## Contributing to National Macroeconomic Stability

To contribute to maintaining the macroeconomic stability,

- Vattanac Bank did its best to help restructure loans to reduce the burden of borrowers whose primary income decreased significantly and therefore faced repayment difficulty.
- We also joined the SME Co-Financing Scheme with SME Bank (established by the Royal Government) to promote the business activities of SMEs, which play a crucial role in driving Cambodia's economic growth.

## Expansion of Branch Network

Despite the challenges caused by the pandemic, Vattanac Bank's Shareholders continued to execute plans to expand the Bank's branch network to all Cities and Provinces of the Kingdom of Cambodia. The Bank also ensured that each branch building is well-structured and stands prominently in the Province where it is located. In 2021, Vattanac Bank opened five new branches:

- Rattanakiri Kiri Provincial Branch
- Preah Vihear Provincial Branch
- Sihanoukville Provincial Branch
- Prey Veng Provincial Branch, and
- Oddar Meanchey Provincial Branch.

# Investing More in Digital Innovation

In 2021, Vattanac Bank continued to invest more in digitalizing our banking services to provide customers with flexible and reliable banking and financial services.

Our Digital Banking Team continued to add new features and made enhancements to the Vattanac Bank App to ensure safe and easy banking for the users. We received favorable feedback from our customers on their experience using the mobile app, thus encouraging us to plan to update further and develop and introduce more functionality for next year.

We also enhanced the features and functionalities of Vattanac Internet Banking, thereby providing convenience and secure access to its individual and corporate users.

We expanded our card system network (such as VISA, MasterCard, and UnionPay International) and integrated with various payment platforms, such as Alipay/WeChat Pay, and NBC’s payment systems - Bakong, FAST, and CSS.

In addition, we established the IT Security and Governance Departments to strengthen further the Bank’s IT security and risk management in support of digital infrastructure development, IT system upgrading, and compliance with NBC’s Technology Risk Management Guidelines.

We also increased our network of ATM/CDM, POS, and merchants in tandem with our growing branch network to bring our banking service closer to customers.

# Reinforcing Human Resources

The Bank’s staff increased by 23.2% to 792 by the end of 2021 compared to 2020. We have always provided opportunities for all staff to acquire new knowledge and skills and improve themselves to advance and become key staff in the Bank and be good citizens of Cambodia.

To facilitate staff development and capacity building, we provided internal training via the Learning and Development Department. We launched our new training center at Toul Kouk Branch in Phnom Penh. Also, we sent our staff to attend external training courses provided by external trainers, especially the Institute of Banking and Finance.

In 2021, we also invested in the Institute of Banking and Finance as a shareholder. The Institute plays a vital role in building Cambodia’s banking sector’s human resource capacity and quality.

# A Good Corporate Citizen

Almost 100% of the Bank’s staff at Head Office and branches in Phnom Penh and Provinces received at least three doses of Covid-19 vaccines at the end of 2021 due to the facilitation and coordination between the Bank and staff of the Ministry of Health. Vaccination is essential to help build community immunity, which would help ensure that the country’s economy can more easily go back to normal.

In addition, the Bank’s Shareholders donated rapid test kits worth US$1M to the Royal Government and provided thousands of liters of alcohol sanitizers and face masks to provincial authorities.

On our tax obligation in 2021, Vattanac Bank continued to be ranked among the Government’s top diligent taxpayers and received a Gold Certificate of Tax Compliance from the General Department of Taxation. The Gold Certificate reflected the Bank’s timely fulfillment of its tax obligation in compliance with all the tax regulations.

# Appreciation

We want to express our deep gratitude to the Bank’s Shareholders and Board of Directors for setting precise directions and showing their confidence in and supporting the Bank’s Management and Staff of all levels in performing their job.

I would also like to take this opportunity to appreciate the Bank’s Management and Staff for their hard work and dedication. We must remember that the future of Vattanac Bank and all of us have undeniably been intertwined. In this regard, any growth recorded by the Bank amounts to our growth.

We would also like to thank the families of the Management and Staff for their trust and their facilitation in enabling them to perform their roles and duties in the Bank.

Lastly, we are profoundly thankful to our customers and partners for their continued support and trust. We will remain firm in our resolve to provide customers the best service and conduct banking operations with honesty, integrity, efficiency, and accountability.

The Directors have pleasure in submitting their report together with the audited financial statements of Vattanac Bank ("the Bank") for the year ended 31 December 2021.

## Principal activities

The Bank is principally engaged in all aspects of banking business and the provision of related financial services.

There were no significant changes to these principal activities during the financial year.

## Financial results

The financial results of the Bank for the year ended 31 December 2021 were as follows:

|                      | 2021 US$       | 2020 US$       | 2021 KHR'000 (Note 5) | 2020 KHR'000 (Note 5) |
|----------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Profit before income tax | 9,178,587      | 10,199,510     | 37,338,491            | 41,583,402            |
| Income tax expense   | (1,831,877)    | (2,135,010)    | (7,452,051)           | (8,704,436)           |
| Net profit for the year | 7,346,716      | 8,064,500      | 29,886,440            | 32,878,966            |

## Dividends

On 8 January 2021, the Board approved to distribute a dividend of US$10,000,000 to its shareholders in respect of the audited retained earnings as at 31 December 2019. The approval from the National Bank of Cambodia on the said dividend distribution was approved on 31 August 2021.

## Share capital

There were no changes in the registered and paid up share capital of the Bank during the year.

## Reserves and provisions

There were no other movements to or from reserves and provisions during the financial year other than those disclosed in the financial statements.

## Loans and advances

Before the financial statements of the Bank were prepared, the Directors took reasonable steps to ascertain that actions had been taken in relation to the writing off of any bad loans and advances and the making of allowance for doubtful loans and advances, and had satisfied themselves that all known bad loans and advances had been written off and adequate allowance had been made for doubtful loans and advances.

At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances, which would render the amount written off for bad loans and advances, or the amount of allowance for doubtful loans and advances in the financial statements of the Bank, inadequate to any material extent.

## Assets

Before the financial statements of the Bank were prepared, the Directors took reasonable steps to ensure that any assets, other than loans and advances, which were unlikely to be realised in the ordinary course of business at their value as shown in the accounting records of the Bank had been written down to an amount which they might be expected to realise.

At the date of this report, the management is not aware of any circumstances, which would render the values attributed to the assets in the financial statements of the Bank misleading.

## Valuation methods

At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances which have arisen which render adherence to the existing method of valuation of assets and liabilities in the financial statements of the Bank misleading or inappropriate.

## Contingent and other liabilities

At the date of this report, there does not exist:
(a) any charge on the assets of the Bank which has arisen since the end of the financial year which secures
- the liabilities of any other person, or
(b) any contingent liability in respect of the Bank that has arisen since the end of the financial year other than in the ordinary course of banking business. No contingent or other liability of the Bank has become enforceable, or is likely to become enforceable within the period of twelve months after the end of the financial year which, in the opinion of the Directors, will or may substantially affect the ability of the Bank to meet its obligations as and when they fall due.

## Change of circumstances

At the date of this report, the Directors are not aware of any circumstances, not otherwise dealt with in this report or the financial statements of the Bank, which would render any amount stated in the financial statements misleading.

## Items of material and unusual nature

The results of the operations of the Bank for the financial year were not, in the opinion of the Directors, substantially affected by any item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature except for:
---
# Report of the Directors (cont.)

## COVID-19 outbreak and its impact on ECL

The ECL was estimated based on a range of forecast economic conditions as at reporting date. The Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has spread across the world including Cambodia, causing disruption to business and economic activity. The impact on GDP and other key indicators has been considered when determining the severity and likelihood of downside economic scenarios that are used to estimate ECL in which the calculation of the ECL in this current environment is subject to significant uncertainty. Management provides its best estimate on the possible outcomes of COVID-19 on the Bank, however, this estimate may move materially as events unfold.

There has not arisen in the interval between the end of the financial year and the date of this report any item, transaction or event of a material and unusual nature likely, in the opinion of the Directors, to affect substantially the results of the operations of the Bank for the current period in which this report is made.

---
# Report of the Independent Auditors
## To the shareholders of Vattanac Bank (cont.)

### Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance CIFRS, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Bank or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Bank’s financial reporting process.

### Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with CISAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with CISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Bank’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Bank to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

# Notes to the Financial Statements
**For the year ended 31 December 2021**

## 1. Reporting entity
Vattanac Bank (the "Bank") was incorporated in Cambodia on 1 July 2002 as a public limited company under the Registration No. 00000665 (formerly Co. 6000/02P). The Bank obtained a license from the National Bank of Cambodia ("NBC") to operate as a commercial bank with effect from 7 June 2002 and officially commenced its operations on 8 November 2002.

The principal activities of the Bank comprise the operations of core banking business and the provision of related financial services through its head office and other branches in Cambodia. There were no changes in the nature of the principal activities during the year.

The registered office of the Bank is located at No. 66, Preah Monivong Boulevard, Sangkat Wat Phnom, Khan Daun Penh, Phnom Penh, Kingdom of Cambodia.

As at 31 December 2021, the Bank had 792 employees (31 December 2020: 643 employees).

## 2. Basis of accounting
The financial statements of the Bank have been prepared in accordance with the Cambodian International Financial Reporting Standards ("CIFRSs").

Details of the Bank's accounting policies are included in Note 34.

The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Bank's Directors on 15 March 2022.

## 3. Functional and presentation currency
The Bank transacts its business and maintains its accounting records in United States Dollars ("US$"). Management has determined the US$ to be the Bank's functional and presentation currency as it reflects the economic substance of the underlying events and circumstances of the Bank.

These financial statements are presented in US$, which is the Bank's functional currency. All amounts have been rounded to the nearest dollar, except when otherwise indicated.

## 4. Use of judgments and estimates
In preparing these financial statements, management has made judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the Bank's accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.

Information about judgments made in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effects on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is included in the following notes.

## 4. Use of judgments and estimates (cont.)

- **Note 34(c)(ii)**: classification of financial assets: assessment of the business model within which the assets are held and assessment of whether the contractual terms of the financial asset are SPPI on the principal amount outstanding.
- **Note 34(c)(ii)**: establishing the criteria for determining whether credit risk on the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, determining methodology for incorporating forward-looking information into measurement of ECL and selection and approval of models used to measure ECL.

Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the year ended 31 December 2021 are included in the following notes:
- **Note 9**: determination of the fair value of financial instruments with significant unobservable inputs.
- **Note 34(c)(ii)**: impairment of financial instruments: determining inputs into the ECL measurement model, including incorporation of forward-looking information.
- **Note 34(c)(iii)**: impairment of financial instruments: key assumptions used in estimating recoverable cash flows.

## 5. Translation of United States Dollars into Khmer Riel

The financial statements are expressed in United States Dollar which is the Bank’s functional currency. The translation of United States Dollars amounts into Khmer Riel (“KHR”) meets the presentation requirements pursuant to Law on Accounting and Auditing and has been done in compliance with CIAS 21: The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.

Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate as at the reporting date and share capital and other equity accounts are translated at the historical rate. The statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and cash flows are translated into KHR at the average rate for the year, which approximates the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions as exchange rates have not fluctuated significantly during the period. The resulting differences arising from the translation are recognised as “Currency Translation Reserves” in other comprehensive income.

The Bank uses the following exchange rates:

| Financial year end | Closing rate | Average rate |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------|
| 31 December 2021   | US$1 = KHR4,074 | KHR4,068 |
| 31 December 2020   | US$1 = KHR4,045 | KHR4,072 |

These convenience translations should not be construed as representations that the United States Dollars amounts have been, could have been, or could in the future be, converted into Khmer Riels at this or any other rate of exchange.

### A. Statutory capital deposit

Under the NBC’s Prakas No. B7-01-136 dated 15 October 2001, the Bank is required to maintain a statutory deposit 10% of its registered capital. This deposit is not available for use in the Bank’s day-to-day operations and is refundable should the Bank voluntarily cease its operations in Cambodia.

### B. Reserve requirements on customers’ deposits

The reserve requirements represent the minimum reserve which is calculated at 8% for KHR and 12.50% for other currencies of the total amount of deposits from customers, non-residential banks and financial institution deposits, and non-residential borrowings. Pursuant to the National Bank of Cambodia’s Prakas No. B7-018-282 on the maintenance of reserve requirements against commercial banks’ deposits and borrowings, reserve requirements both in KHR and in other currencies bear no interest effective from 29 August 2018.

On 17 March 2020, the NBC announced the reduction of the Reserve Requirements Rate (“RRR”) to 7% for both local and foreign currencies deposits and borrowings in order to help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Cambodia’s economy, which is still applicable for the year ended 31 December 2021.

This represents provision for seniority indemnity payments required by Prakas No. 443 issued by the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training ("MoLVT") on 21 September 2018, and subsequently amended by the Instruction No. 042/19 dated 22 March 2019. It requires all employers to settle the seniority indemnity to their employees as follows:
- **Current pay**: starting from 2019 onwards at the amounts equal to 15 days of wages and other benefits per year.
- **Retrospective (back-pay)**: starting from end of 2021 onwards at the amounts equal to 6 days of net wages per year. The provision of back-pay seniority indemnity is calculated at a maximum amount of 6 months net wages (depends on the length of the service employee served) to the employee who has seniority before 2019.

On 2 June 2020, the MoLVT issued Prakas No. 018/20 for the postponement of seniority indemnity back-pay for periods before 2019 and postponement of seniority indemnity current pay in 2020. Under this new measure, both the issuance of seniority indemnity back-pay for periods before 2019, and the issuance of seniority indemnity current pay for 2020 are to be paid in 2022.

Payments will be made twice a year, in June and December respectively. Employees are not entitled to the remaining seniority indemnity back-pay, which is not yet due, if he/she resigns from the Bank.

**For the year ended 31 December 2021**

## 32. Financial risk management

### A. Introduction and overview

The Bank has exposure to the following risks from financial instruments:
- credit risk;
- market risk;
- liquidity risk;
- operational risk; and
- capital management

This note presents information about the Bank’s exposure to each of the above risks, the Bank’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Bank’s management of capital.

For the purpose of preserving the financial stability and reduce the burden of the borrowers who are losing their primary incomes and facing difficulties in repayment during the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank works constructively with affected borrowers and allows for loan restructuring. Loan restructuring is carried out by the Bank’s special unit that is independent from the lending department. This special unit shall regularly conduct a portfolio review of affected borrowers to measure the impact on their financial conditions during the pandemic.

### Risk management functional and governance structure

The Bank does not use derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange contract and interest rate swaps to manage its risk exposures.

The Directors have overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Bank’s risk management. The Directors have established the Audit Committee, Risk Management and Compliance Committee and New Activities and Products Committee which are responsible for developing and monitoring Bank risk management policies in their specified areas. All Board committees have both executive and non-executive members and report regularly to the Directors on their activities.

The Risk Management and Compliance Committee was established to assist the Directors in its role and responsibilities over risk management and compliance of the Bank relating to risks in business operations and risk monitoring process. These include risk identification, risk management, risk monitoring and effective compliance with laws and regulations in accordance with the Bank’s risk management policies approved by the Directors. The Risk Management and Compliance Department plays an important role on a day-to-day basis in assisting the Risk Management and Compliance Committee to monitor the potential risks associated with the operations of the Bank and its branches and compliance controls of the Bank to meet the requirements of laws and regulations including laws and Prakas on Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism set out by the NBC.

The Audit Committee is assisted in these functions by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad-hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee. In addition, the Audit Committee monitors and evaluates the efficiency of the risk management structure, policies and procedures, activities and operations of the Bank as well as compliance with laws and regulations.

The New Activities and Products Committee was established to assist the Directors to ensure that policies, charters and guidelines are in place in order to assess, evaluate and mitigate the risks pertaining to new products/ new activities to be introduced.

### B. Credit risk

‘Credit risk’ is the risk of financial loss to the Bank if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from the Bank’s loans and advances to customers and other banks, and investment debt securities. For risk management reporting purposes, the Bank considers and consolidates all elements of credit risk exposure – e.g. individual obligor default risk, country and sector risk.

Credit risk is the potential loss of revenue and principal losses arising mainly from loans and advances and loan commitments as a result of default by the borrowers or counterparties through its lending activities.

#### (i). Management of credit risk

The lending activities are guided by the Bank’s credit policy to ensure that the overall objectives in the area of lending are achieved; i.e., that the loan portfolio is strong and healthy, and credit risks are well diversified. The credit policy documents the lending policy, collateral policy and credit approval processes, including the Bank’s own internal credit risk rating system, and procedures implemented to ensure compliance with NBC Guidelines.

The Bank has established the Core Credit Risk Policy which is designed to govern the Bank’s credit risk activities. Extension of credit is governed by credit programs that set out the plan for a particular product or portfolio, including the target market, terms and conditions, documentation and procedures under which a credit product will be offered and measured.

### B. Credit risk

#### (ii) Risk limit control and mitigation policies

The Bank employs a range of policies and practices to mitigate credit risk. The most traditional of these is the taking of security in the form of collateral for loans to customers, which is common practice. The Bank implements guidelines on the acceptability of specific classes of collateral. The principal collateral types to secure for loans to customers are:

- Hypothec/mortgages over residential and business properties (land, buildings and other properties); and
- Cash in the form of fixed and margin deposits.

#### (iii) Concentration of risk

The Directors created the Bank Credit Committee for the oversight of credit risk. A separate Bank Credit department, reporting to the Bank Credit Committee, is responsible for managing the Bank’s credit risk, including the following.

The following table presents the Bank’s maximum exposure to credit risk of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments, without taking into account of any collateral held or other credit enhancements. For on-balance sheet assets, the exposure to credit risk equals their carrying amount. For contingent liabilities, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the maximum amount that the Bank would have to pay if the obligations of the instruments issued are called upon. For credit commitments, the maximum exposure to credit risk is the full amount of the undrawn credit facilities granted to customers.

(*) A "large exposure" is defined under the NBC's Prakas as the overall gross exposure of the aggregate balance of loans and advances with one single beneficiary, which exceeds 10% of the Bank's net worth. The exposure is the higher of the outstanding loans or commitments and the authorised loans or commitments.

(**) A "restructured loan" is a loan that original contractual terms have been modified to provide for concessions for the borrowers for reasons related to real temporary financial difficulties.

##### (iv) Collateral

Whilst the Bank's maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount of the assets or, in the case of off-balance sheet instruments, the amount guaranteed, committed, accepted or endorsed, the likely exposure may be lower due to offsetting collateral, credit guarantees and other actions taken to mitigate the Bank's exposure.

#### (iv) Collateral (cont.)

The description of collateral for each class of financial asset is set out below.

**Cash equivalents with other banks, placements with other banks, other assets and debt investments**

Collateral is generally not sought for these assets.

**Loans and advances to customers, contingent liabilities and commitments**

Certain loans and advances to customers, contingent liabilities and commitments are typically collateralised to a substantial extent. In particular, residential mortgage exposures are generally fully secured by residential properties.

#### (v) Credit quality analysis

From 27 March 2020, the Bank has applied Circular No. B7-020-001 issued by the NBC on loan restructuring to support customers affected by COVID-19 by:
- reducing the amount of loan principal or amount to be repaid at the maturity;
- lowering interest rate than original contractual terms;
- deferring the repayment of principal or interest or capitalised interest;
- extending the maturity date; adding and/or modifying co-borrower and/or guarantor, when applicable;
- changing an instalment loan to an interest payment only where the principal is repaid at the maturity (bullet loan);
- releasing collaterals or accepting lower level of collateralisation; and
- easing of covenants on/and providing grace period for repayment up to 6 months from the effective signing date of the new contract.

Accordingly, for customers who paid principal payment or interest, or both payments not past due more than 90 days (performing loan) and are expected to be experiencing only temporary financial and repayment difficulties. NBC allows loan restructuring to all sectors impacted by COVID-19 pandemic and floods based on the Bank’s own evaluation.

On 28 December 2021, the NBC issued a new Circular, No. B7-021-2314 CL on Classification and Provisioning Requirement on Restructure Loans, which aims at phasing out the forbearance period for the existing restructured loans and phasing the classification and provisioning arrangements complying with the current regulation, Prakas No. B7-017-344 dated 01 December 2017 on Credit Risk Grading and Impairment Provisioning. In this regard, all restructured loans by 31 December 2021 shall be classified and provisioned based on the requirements under this circular. For loans that were still in the assessment period, they shall be kept at the same classification as before the restructured terms if consistent.

Following the NBC’s workshop on “the Circular on Classification and Provisioning Requirement for Restructured Loans” held on 18 January 2022, the NBC issued a communication on 4 February 2022 allowing banks and financial institutions (“BFIs”) to defer the implementation of the new Circular until January 2022 and through early adoption is encouraged. The Bank chose to defer the implementation of the new Circular in preparing these financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021.

Pursuant to the NBC guideline Prakas B7-017-344, it has defined each credit grading according to its credit quality as follows:

| 31 December 2021 | Unsecured credit exposure | Collateralized credit enhancement |
|------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|

**Normal:**
Outstanding facility is repaid on timely manner and is not in doubt for the future repayment. Repayment is steadily made according with the contractual terms and the facility does not exhibit any potential weakness in repayment capability, business, cash flow and financial position of the counterparty.

**Special Mention:**
A facility in this class is currently protected and may not be past due but it exhibits potential weaknesses that may adversely affect repayment of the counterparty at the future date, if not corrected in a timely manner, and close attention by the Institution.

Weaknesses include but are not limited to a declining trend in the business operations of the counterparty or in its financial position, adverse economic and market conditions that all might affect its profitability and its future repayment capacity or deteriorating conditions on the collateral. This class has its own rational and should not be used as a compromise between Normal and Substandard.

**Substandard:**
A facility ranked in this class exhibits noticeable weakness and is not adequately protected by the current business or financial position and repayment capacity of the counterparty. In essence, the primary source of repayment is not sufficient to service the debt, not taking into account the income from secondary sources such as the realization of the collateral.

Factors leading to a substandard classification include:
- Inability of the counterparty to meet the contractual repayments’ terms,
- Unfavourable economic and market conditions that would adversely affect the business and profitability of the counterparty in the future,
- Weakened financial condition and/or inability of the counterparty to generate enough cash flow to service the payments,
- Difficulties experienced by the counterparty in repaying other facilities granted by the Institution or by other institutions when the information is available, and Breach of financial covenants by the counterparty.

**Doubtful:**
A facility classified in this category exhibits more severe weaknesses than one classified Substandard such that its full collection on the basis of existing facts, conditions or collateral value is highly questionable or improbable. The prospect of loss is high, even if the exact amount remains undetermined for now.

**Loss:**
A facility is classified loss when it is not collectable, and little or nothing can be done to recover the outstanding amount from the counterparty.

**Recognition of ECL:**
The Bank apply a three-stage approach based on the change in credit quality since initial recognition:

| 3-Stage approach | Stage 1 Performing | Stage 2 Underperforming | Stage 3 Nonperforming |
|------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| Recognition of expected credit losses | 12 months expected credit losses | Lifetime expected credit losses | Lifetime expected credit losses |
| Criterion | No significant increase in credit risk | Credit risk increased significantly | Credit impaired assets |
| Basic of calculation of profit revenue | On gross carrying amount | On gross carrying amount | On net carrying amount |

The Bank will measure ECL by using the general approach. The general approach consists of segregating the customers into three different stages according to the staging criteria by assessing the credit risk. 12-month ECL will be computed for stage 1, while lifetime ECL will be computed for stage 2 and stage 3. At each reporting date, the Bank will assess credit risk of each account as compared to the risk level at origination date.

**Long-term facilities (more than one year)**

| Stage | Credit Risk Status | Grades | DPD | Default Indicator |
|-------|--------------------|--------|-----|-------------------|
| 1     | No significant increase in credit risk | Normal | 0 ≤ DPD < 30 | Performing |
| 2     | Credit risk increased significantly | Special Mention | 30 ≤ DPD < 90 | Underperforming |
| 3     | Credit impaired assets | Substandard | 90 ≤ DPD < 180 | Nonperforming |
|       |                      | Doubtful | 180 ≤ DPD < 360 | Nonperforming |
|       |                      | Loss | DPD ≥ 360 | Nonperforming |

|       |                     | Loss | DPD ≥ 91 | Nonperforming |

The Bank will use the day past due (DPD) information and NBC’s classification for staging criteria. Also, the Bank will incorporate credit scoring or more forward looking elements in the future when information is more readily available.

As for financial assets that are short term in nature, simplified approach will be adopted where no staging criteria is required. In this case, it will be either performing (stage1) or non-performing.

The table below summarises the credit quality of the Bank’s gross financing according to the above classifications.

### Significant increase in credit risk

The Bank has supported and complied with the NBC regulations by offering loan restructuring facilities via either providing grace period or providing full moratorium to its impacted customers. Even though a portion of the Bank’s loan portfolio has been restructured, most of these restructured customers still indicate positive business prospects for the Bank and are still able to service their regular interest payments.

From perspective of the Bank’s Management, the extension of grace period and/or moratorium should not automatically result in significant increase in credit risk (SICR); thereby, all restructured loans should not necessarily be required to move between stages unless significant in credit risks exist.

For general treatment of staging transfer criteria for loan restructuring portfolio, the Bank determines that if the customer is offered grace period (i.e. service only interest payment or only principal payment) and customer is able to service payment regularly, no SICR exists.

While for customer who is offered full moratorium (i.e. delay all types of payments), individual assessment is to be performed and Credit Committee will then review and approve whether there is any SICR.

### Incorporation of forward-looking information

The Bank incorporates forward-looking information into both the assessment of whether the credit risk of an instrument has increased significantly since its initial recognition and the measurement of ECL.

External information considered includes economic data and forecasts published by governmental bodies and monetary authorities in the countries where the Bank operates, supranational organisations such as the World Bank, and selected private-sector and academic forecasters.

The Bank used the macroeconomic historical data is being taken from the World Bank published data. In order to forecast the probability of default for future years, the known quarterly Observed Default Rates (“ODRs”) are regressed against the quarterly macro-economic variables (“MEV”) values. The Bank has used a time weighted average methodology in order to forecast future MEVs. A forward-looking scalar is computed as the ratio of the ODR based on the most recently known MEV and the forecasted MEV.

The MEVs are shocked in order to generate base, best- and worst-case scenarios. This has been done by computing the standard deviation of the known historical values of the MEV and adjusting the base value by +/- 1 standard deviation to generate best- and worst-case scenarios.

**COVID-19 Outbreak and Impact on ECL**

The Bank has identified and documented key drivers of credit risk and credit losses for each portfolio of financial instruments in accordance with each country and, using an analysis of historical data, has estimated relationships between macro-economic variables and credit risk and credit losses.

In response to the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank has determined that the economic outlook for the upcoming years is likely to be back to normal and therefore sets forth of new set of economic (and loss) scenarios accordingly.

The Bank has revised its economic forecasts used as an input into ECL as at 31 December 2021 down from 2020. The Bank believes that the adjustment reflects more recent economic conditions.

For the purpose of ECL computation, to reflect the current and future probable economic condition the Bank has taken into account the eased economic scenarios during this COVID-19 pandemic by revisiting its probability-weighted outcome (PWO) and putting lesser weight on the worst-case scenario and a higher weight on the best-case scenario.

The table below show the scenario probability weighted percentage as at 31 December 2021 and as at 31 December 2020 are in post COVID-19 pandemic.

| Probability weightage outcome | Baseline % | Best % | Worst % |
|-------------------------------|------------|--------|---------|
| As at 31 December 2021        | 40%        | 35%    | 25%     |

Foreign currency exchange risk is the risk that the value of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates.

### D. Liquidity risk

'Liquidity risk' is the risk that the Bank will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Liquidity risk arises from mismatches in the timing and amounts of cash flows, which is inherent to the Bank's operations and investments.

#### Management of liquidity risk

The Bank manages its liquidity through its Asset Liability Management Committee which is responsible for establishing the liquidity policy as well as monitoring liquidity on an ongoing basis. A Minimum Liquid Asset requirement has been established to ensure that the ratio of liquid assets to qualifying liabilities is subject to a minimum threshold at all times.

The table below summarises the Bank's assets and liabilities based on remaining contractual maturities. The expected cash flows of these assets and liabilities could vary significantly from what is shown in the table. For example, deposits from customers are not all expected to be withdrawn immediately.

# Notes to the Financial Statements (Cont.)

For the year ended 31 December 2021

## 32. Financial risk management (cont.)

### E. Operational risk

The operational risk is the risk of losses arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or systems or from external factors. This risk is managed through established operational risk management processes, proper monitoring and reporting of the business activities by control and oversight provided by the senior Management. This includes legal, compliance, accounting and fraud risk.

The operational risk management entails the establishment of clear organizational structures, roles and control policies. Various internal control policies and measures have been implemented. These include the establishment of signing authorities, defining system parameters controls, streamlining procedures and documentation ensuring compliance with regulatory and legal requirements. These are reviewed continually to address the operational risks of its banking business.

### F. Capital management

#### (i) Regulatory capital

The Bank’s objectives when managing capital, which is a broader concept than the “equity” on the face of the statement of financial position, are:
- To comply with the capital requirements set by the NBC;
- To safeguard the Bank’s ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders; and
- To maintain a strong capital base to support the development of the business.

The Bank’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain market confidence and to sustain further development of the business. The impact of the level of capital on shareholders’ return is also recognised and the Bank recognised the need to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with greater gearing and advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.

#### (ii) Capital allocation

The allocation of capital between specific operations and activities is, to a large extent, driven by optimisation of the return achieved on the capital allocated. The amount of capital allocated to each operation or activity is based primarily upon the regulatory capital.

## 33. Fair values of financial assets and liabilities

Financial instruments comprise financial assets, financial liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Bank has access at that date. The information presented herein represents the estimates of fair values as at the financial position date.

Quoted and observable market prices, where available, are used as the measure of fair values of the financial instruments. Where such quoted and observable market prices are not available, fair values are estimated based on a range of methodologies and assumptions regarding risk characteristics of various financial instruments, discount rates, estimates of future cash flows and other factors.

Fair value information for non-financial assets and liabilities are excluded as they do not fall within the scope of CIFRS7: Financial Instruments Disclosures which requires the fair value information to be disclosed. These include investment in subsidiaries and property and equipment.

The fair value of the Bank’s financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalent, placement with other banks, debt investments, deposits from customers and banks, other assets, borrowing and other liabilities are not materially sensitive to shifts in market profit rate because of the limited term to maturity of these instruments. As such, the carrying value of these financial assets and liabilities at financial position date approximate their fair values.

The fair values are based on the following methodologies and assumptions:

### Investments

The estimated fair values are generally based on quoted and observable market prices.

Where there is no ready market in certain securities, fair values have been estimated by reference to market indicative yields or net tangible asset backing of the investee.

### Financing, advances and others

The fair value is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using the prevailing market rates of financing with similar credit risks and maturities.

CIFRS 7 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources and unobservable inputs reflect the Bank’s market assumptions. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:
- **Level 1** – Quoted price (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. This level includes listed equity securities and debt instruments.
- **Level 2** – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices).
- **Level 3** – Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). This level includes equity investments and debt instruments with significant unobservable components.

*For the year ended 31 December 2021*

## 33. Fair values of financial assets and liabilities (continued)

### Fair value hierarchy
The Bank’s financial assets and liability are not measured at fair value. As verifiable market prices are not available, market prices are not available for a significant proportion of the Bank’s financial assets and liabilities, the fair values, therefore, have been based on management assumptions according to the profile of the asset and liability base. In the opinion of the management, the carrying amounts of the financial assets and liabilities included in the balance sheet are a reasonable estimation of their fair values.

## 34. Significant accounting policies
The Bank has consistently applied the following accounting policies to all periods presented in these financial statements unless otherwise indicated (Note 35).

### A. Basis of measurement
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis.

### B. Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency of the Bank at the spot exchange rates at the date of the transactions.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate at the reporting date. The foreign currency gain or loss on monetary items is the difference between the amortised cost in the functional currency at the beginning of the year, adjusted for effective interest and payments during the year, and the amortised cost in the foreign currency translated at the spot exchange rate at the end of the year. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the spot exchange rate at the date on which the fair value is determined. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

### C. Financial assets and financial liabilities

#### (i) Recognition and initial measurement
The Bank initially recognises loans and advances, and debt investments on the date on which they are originated. All other financial instruments (including regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets) are recognised on the trade date, which is the date on which the Bank becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

A financial asset or financial liability is measured initially at fair value plus, for an item not at FVTPL, transaction costs that are directly attributable to its acquisition or issue.

#### (ii) Classification

**Financial assets**
On initial recognition, a financial asset is classified as measured at: amortised cost, FVOCI or FVTPL.

A financial asset is measured at amortised cost if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:
- The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
- The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

A debt instrument is measured at FVOCI only if it meets both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:
- The asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and
- The contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are SPPI.

On initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Bank may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in OCI. This election is made on an investment-by-investment basis.

All other financial assets are classified as measured at FVTPL.

In addition, on initial recognition, the Bank may irrevocably designate a financial asset that otherwise meets the requirements to be measured at amortised cost or at FVOCI as at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.

**Business model assessment**
The Bank makes an assessment of the objective of a business model in which an asset is held at a portfolio level because this best reflects the way the business is managed and information is provided to management. The information considered includes:
- The stated policies and objectives for the portfolio and the operation of those policies in practice. In particular, whether management’s strategy focuses on earning contractual interest revenue, maintaining a particular interest rate profile, matching the duration of the financial assets to the duration of the liabilities that are funding those assets or realising cash flows through the sale of the assets;
- How the performance of the portfolio is evaluated and reported to the Bank’s management;
- The risks that affect the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and its strategy for how those risks are managed;

# Notes to the Financial Statements (Cont.)

**For the year ended 31 December 2021**

## 34. Significant accounting policies
### C. Financial assets and financial liabilities (cont.)
#### Business model assessment (cont.)

- how managers of the business are compensated (e.g. whether compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or the contractual cash flows collected); and
- the frequency, volume and timing of sales in prior periods, the reasons for such sales and its expectations about future sales activity. However, information about sales activity is not considered in isolation, but as part of an overall assessment of how the Bank’s stated objective for managing the financial assets is achieved and how cash flows are realised.

Financial assets that are held for trading or managed and whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis are measured at FVTPL because they are neither held to collect contractual cash flows nor held both to collect contractual cash flows and to sell financial assets.

#### Assessment of whether contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest

For the purposes of this assessment, ‘principal’ is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition. ‘Interest’ is defined as consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time and for other basic lending risks and costs (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs), as well as profit margin.

In making the assessment, the Bank considers:
- contingent events that would change the amount and timing of cash flows;
- leverage features;
- prepayment and extension terms;
- terms that limit the Bank’s claim to cash flows from specified assets (e.g. non-recourse loans); and
- features that modify consideration of the time value of money (e.g. periodical reset of interest rates).

#### Non-recourse loans

In some cases, loans made by the Bank that are secured by collateral of the borrower limit the Bank’s claim to cash flows of the underlying collateral (non-recourse loans). The Bank applies judgment in assessing whether the non-recourse loans meet the SPPI criterion. The Bank typically considers the following information when making its judgement:
- whether the contractual arrangement specifically defines the amounts and dates of the cash payments of the loan;
- the fair value of the collateral relative to the amount of the secured financial asset;
- the ability and willingness of the borrower to make contractual payments, not withstanding a decline in the value of collateral;
- whether the borrower is an individual or a substantive operating entity or is a special-purpose entity;
- the Bank’s risk of loss on the asset relative to a full-recourse loan;
- the extent to which the collateral represents all or a substantial portion of the borrower’s assets; and
- whether the Bank will benefit from any upside from the underlying assets.

#### Reclassifications

Financial assets are not reclassified subsequent to their initial recognition, except in the period after the Bank changes its business model for managing financial assets.

#### Financial liabilities

Financial liabilities are generally classified as other financial liabilities and measured at amortised cost unless they meet the criteria for ‘fair value through profit or loss’.

The Bank derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or it transfers the rights to receive the contractual cash flows in a transaction in which substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Bank neither transfers nor retains substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership and it does not retain control of the financial asset.

On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount of the asset (or the carrying amount allocated to the portion of the asset derecognised) and the sum of (i) the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and (ii) any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI is recognised in profit and loss.

##### Financial liabilities

The Bank derecognises a financial liability when its contractual obligations are discharged or cancelled, or expired.

#### (iv). Modifications of financial assets and financial liabilities
##### Financial assets

If the terms of a financial asset are modified, then the Bank evaluates whether the cash flows of the modified asset are substantially different.

#### (iv). Modifications of financial assets and financial liabilities (cont.)

**Financial assets (cont.)**

If the cash flows are substantially different, then the contractual rights to cash flows from the original financial asset are deemed to have expired. In this case, the original financial asset is derecognised (see (iii)) and a new financial asset is recognised at fair value plus any eligible transaction costs. Any fees received as part of the modification are accounted for as follows:

- Fees that are considered in determining the fair value of the new asset and fees that represent reimbursement of eligible transaction costs are included in the initial measurement of the asset; and
- Other fees are included in profit and loss as part of the gain or loss on derecognition.

If cash flows are modified when the borrower is in financial difficulties, then the objective of the modification is usually to maximise recovery of the original contractual terms rather than to originate a new asset with substantially different terms. If the Bank plan to modify a financial asset in a way that would result in forgiveness of cash flows, then it first considers whether a portion of the asset should be written off before the modification takes place (see below for write-off policy). This approach impacts the result that the quantitative evaluation and means that the derecognition criteria are not usually met in such cases.

If the modification of a financial asset measured at amortised cost or FVOCI does not result in derecognition of the financial asset, then the Bank first recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset using the original effective interest rate of the asset and recognises the resulting adjustment as a modification gain or loss in profit and loss. For floating-rate financial assets, the original effective interest rate used to calculate the modification gain or loss is adjusted to reflect current market terms at the time of the modification. Any costs or fees incurred and fees received as part of the modification adjust the gross carrying amount of the modified financial asset and are amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial asset.

If such a modification is carried out because of financial difficulties of the borrower, then the gain or loss is presented together with impairment losses. In other cases, it is presented as interest income calculated using the effective interest rate method.

**Financial liabilities**

The Bank derecognise a financial liability when its terms are modified and the cash flows of the modified liability are substantially different. In this case, a new financial liability based on the modified terms is recognised at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and consideration paid is recognised in profit and loss. Consideration paid includes non-financial assets transferred, if any, and the assumption of liabilities, including the new modified financial liability.

If the modification of a financial liability is not accounted for as derecognition, then the amortised cost of the liability is recalculated by discounting the modified cash flows at the original effective interest rate and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit and loss. For floating-rate financial liabilities, the original effective interest rate used to calculate the modification gain or loss is adjusted to reflect current market terms at the time of the modification. Any costs and fees incurred are recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the liability and amortised over the remaining term of the modified financial liability by re-computing the effective interest rate on the instrument.

**Interest rate benchmark reform**

If the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability measured at amortised cost changes as a result of interest rate benchmark reform, then the Bank first updates the effective interest rate of the financial asset or financial liability to reflect the change that is required by the interest rate benchmark reform. After that, the Bank applies the policies on accounting for modifications set out above to the additional changes.

#### (v). Offsetting

Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when, and only when, the Bank has a legal right to offset the amounts and it intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

#### (vi). Fair value measurement

'Fair value' is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal, or in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the Bank has access at that date. The fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.

## 34. Significant accounting policies (cont.)

### C. Financial assets and financial liabilities (cont.)

#### (vi). Fair value measurement (cont.)

When one is available, the Bank measures the fair value of an instrument using the quoted price in an active market for that instrument. A market is regarded as ‘active’ if transactions for the asset or liability take place with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

If there is no quoted price in an active market, then the Bank uses valuation techniques that maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and minimise the use of unobservable inputs. The chosen valuation technique incorporates all of the factors that market participants would take into account in pricing a transaction.

The best evidence of the fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price – i.e. the fair value of the consideration given or received. If the Bank determines that the fair value on initial recognition differs from the transaction price and the fair value is evidenced neither by a quoted price in an active market for an identical asset or liability nor based on a valuation technique for which any unobservable inputs are judged to be insignificant in relation to the measurement, then the financial instrument is initially measured at fair value, adjusted to defer the difference between the fair value on initial recognition and the transaction price. Subsequently, that difference is recognised in profit and loss on an appropriate basis over the life of the instrument but no later than when the valuation is wholly supported by observable market data or the transaction is closed out.

If an asset or a liability measured at fair value has a bid price and an ask price, then the Bank measures assets and long positions at a bid price and liabilities and short positions at an ask price.

Portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities that are exposed to market risk and credit risk that are managed by the Bank on the basis of the net exposure to either market or credit risk are measured on the basis of a price that would be received to sell a net long position (or paid to transfer a net short position) for the particular risk exposure. Portfolio-level adjustments – e.g. bid-ask adjustment or credit risk adjustments that reflect the measurement on the basis of the net exposure – are allocated to the individual assets and liabilities on the basis of the relative risk adjustment of each of the individual instruments in the portfolio.

The fair value of a financial liability with a demand feature (e.g. a demand deposit) is not less than the amount payable on demand, discounted from the first date on which the amount could be required to be paid.

The Bank recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred.

#### (vii). Impairment

The Bank recognises loss allowances for ECL on the following financial instruments that are not measured at FVTPL:
- financial assets that are debt instruments; and
- loan commitments issued.

No impairment loss is recognised on equity investments.

The Bank measures loss allowances at an amount equal to lifetime ECL, except for the following, for which they are measured as 12-month ECL:
- debt investments that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and
- other financial instruments (other than lease receivables) on which credit risk has not increased significantly since their initial recognition.

12-month ECL are the portion of ECL that result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within 12 months after the reporting date. Financial instruments for which a 12-month ECL is recognised are referred to as ‘Stage 1 financial instruments’.

Lifetime ECL are the ECL that result from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument. Financial instruments on which a lifetime ECL is recognised but which are not credit-impaired are referred to as ‘Stage 2 financial instruments’.

At each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether the credit risk of a financial instrument has increased significantly since initial recognition. When credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs.

When determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition and when estimating ECLs, the Bank considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. This includes both quantitative and qualitative information and analysis, based on the Bank’s historical experience and informed credit assessment and includes forward-looking information.

If credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition or if the credit quality of the financial instruments improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to 12-month ECLs.

The maximum period considered when estimating ECLs is the maximum contractual period over which the Bank is exposed to credit risk.

###### Determining whether credit risk has increased significantly

The Bank assesses whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition at each reporting date. Determining whether an increase in credit risk is significant depends on the characteristics of the financial instrument and the borrower, and the geographical region.

- The Bank considers that a significant increase in credit risk occurs no later than when an asset is more than 30 days past due. Days past due are determined by counting the number of days since the earliest elapsed due date in respect of which full payment has not been received. Due dates are determined without considering any grace period that might be available to the borrower.
- If there is evidence that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk relative to initial recognition, then the loss allowance on an instrument returns to being measured as 12-month ECL.

###### Definition of default

The Bank considers a financial asset to be in default when:
- the borrower is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the Bank in full, without recourse by the Bank to actions such as realising security (if any is held); or
- The Bank considers that a significant increase in credit risk occurs no later than when an asset is more than or equal to 30 days past due for long-term facilities or more than or equal to 15 days past due for short-term facilities.

###### Measurement of ECL

ECL are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. They are measured as follows:
- financial assets that are not credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e. the difference between the cash flows due to the entity in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive);
- financial assets that are credit-impaired at the reporting date: as the difference between the gross carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows; and
- undrawn loan commitments: as the present value of the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Bank if the commitment is drawn down and the cash flows that the Bank expects to receive.

###### Inputs, assumptions and techniques used for estimating impairment

The key inputs into the measurement of ECL are the term structure of the following variables:
- Probability of default ("PD");
- Loss given default ("LGD"); and
- Exposure at default ("EAD").

ECL for exposures in Stage 1 is calculated by multiplying the 12-month PD by LGD and EAD. Lifetime ECL is calculated by multiplying the lifetime PD by LGD and EAD.

The statistical model has been employed to analyse data collected and generate estimate of remaining lifetime PD of exposure and how these are expected to change as result of passage of time.

LGD is the magnitude of the likely loss if there is a default. The Bank estimates LGD parameters by benchmarking the value using BASEL IRBF parameter set at 44% and 30% for senior claims on corporates, sovereigns and banks.

EAD represents the expected exposure in the event of a default. The Bank derives the EAD from the current exposure to the counterparty and potential changes to the current amount allowed under the contract and arising from amortisation. The EAD of a financial asset is its gross carrying amount at the time of default. For lending commitments, the EADs are potential future amounts that may be drawn under the contract, which are estimated based on historical observations and forward-looking forecasts. For some financial assets, EAD is determined by modelling the range of possible exposure outcomes at various points in time using scenario and statistical techniques.

As described above, and subject to using a maximum of a 12-month PD for Stage 1 financial assets, the Bank measures ECL considering the risk of default over the maximum contractual period (including any borrower's extension options) over which it is exposed to credit risk, even if for credit risk management purposes, the Bank considers a longer period. The maximum contractual period extends to the date at which the Bank has the right to require repayment of an advance or terminate a loan commitment or guarantee.

###### Restructured financial assets

If the terms of a financial asset are renegotiated or modified or an existing financial asset is replaced with a new one due to financial difficulties of the borrower, then an assessment is made of whether the financial asset should be derecognised and ECL are measured as follows:
- If the expected restructuring will not result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected cash flows arising from the modified financial asset are included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing asset.

---
# Notes to the Financial Statements (Cont.)

For the year ended 31 December 2021

- If the expected restructuring will result in derecognition of the existing asset, then the expected fair value of the new asset is treated as the final cash flow from the existing financial asset at the time of its derecognition. This amount is included in calculating the cash shortfalls from the existing financial asset that are discounted from the expected date of derecognition to the reporting date using the original effective interest rate of the existing financial asset.
- the disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties.
- A loan that has been renegotiated due to a deterioration in the borrower's condition is usually considered to be credit-impaired unless there is evidence that the risk of not receiving contractual cash flows has reduced significantly and there are no other indicators of impairment. In addition, a loan that is overdue for 90 days or more is considered credit-impaired even when the regulatory definition of default is different.

## 34. Significant accounting policies (cont.)

### C. Financial assets and financial liabilities (cont.)

#### (viii). Impairment (cont.)

**Credit-impaired financial assets**

At each reporting date, the Bank assesses whether financial assets carried at amortised cost and debt financial assets carried at FVOCI are credit-impaired (referred to as Stage 3 financial assets). A financial asset is 'credit-impaired' when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset have occurred.

Evidence that a financial asset is credit-impaired includes the following observable data:

- significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer;
- a breach of contract such as a default or past due event;
- the restructuring of a loan or advance by the Bank on terms that the Bank would not consider otherwise;
- it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or

**Presentation of allowance for ECL in the statement of financial position**

Loss allowances for ECL are presented in the statement of financial position for financial assets measured at amortised cost as a deduction from the gross carrying amount of the assets.

Allowance for financial guarantee contracts are presented in a separate liability in the statement of financial position.

**Write-off**

Loans and advances are written off (either partially or in full) when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Bank determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. This assessment is carried out at the individual asset level.

Recoveries of amounts previously written off are generally included in 'impairment losses on financial instruments' in the statement of profit and loss and OCI. In the event such recoveries are material, a separate line item will be included in "other income".

Financial assets that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the Bank's procedures for recovery of amounts due.

### D. Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and bank balances, demand deposits and short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased, and that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

Cash equivalents with other banks are receivable on demand or on short notice and are classified as amortised cost in the statement of financial position. The cash and cash equivalents are held with bank and financial institution counterparties, which are rated A+ to AA-, based on Standard & Poor's MOODY and Bloomberg ratings.

### E. Share capital

Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of the ordinary share are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects. Other shares are classified as equity and/or liability according to the economic substance of the particular instrument. Distributions to holders of a financial instrument classified as an equity instrument are charged directly to equity.

### F. Regulatory reserves

Regulatory reserves are set up for the variance of provision on financial instruments between impairment losses in accordance with CIFRS and regulatory provision in accordance with National Bank of Cambodia's Prakas No. B7-017-344 dated 1 December 2017 and Circular No. B7-018-001 Sor Bor Chor Nor dated 16 February 2018 on credit risk classification and provision impairment for banks and financial institutions. In accordance with Article 73, the entity shall compare the provision calculated in accordance with Article 49 to 71 and the provision calculated in accordance with Article 72, and record:

(i) In case that the regulatory provision calculated in accordance with Article 72 is lower than provision calculated in accordance with Article 49 to 71, the entity records the provision calculated in accordance with CIFRSs;
(ii) In case that the regulatory provision calculated in accordance with Article 72 is higher than provision calculated in accordance with Article 49 to 71, the entity records the provision calculated in accordance with CIFRS and transfer the difference from retained earnings or accumulated loss into regulatory reserves in shareholders' equity account.

The regulatory reserves are not an item to be included in the calculation of the Bank's net worth.

## 34. Significant accounting policies (cont.)

### G. Placements with other banks
Placements with other banks are stated at amortised cost less impairment for any uncollectable amounts.

### H. Statutory deposits
Statutory deposits are stated at cost and included balances with the NBC, are maintained in compliance with the Cambodian Law on Banking and Financial Institutions and are determined by the defined percentage of the minimum share capital and the customers' deposits as required by the NBC.

### I. Loans and advances
'Loans and advances' captions in the statement of financial position include loans and advances measured at amortised cost; they are initially measured at fair value plus incremental direct transaction costs, and subsequently at their amortised cost using the effective interest method.

### J. Other assets
Other assets are carried at amortised cost less impairment if any.

### K. Property and equipment

#### (i). Recognition and measurement
Items of property and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.

Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling and removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. The cost of self-constructed assets also includes the cost of materials and direct labour. For qualifying assets, borrowing costs are capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy on borrowing costs. Cost also may include transfers from equity of any gain or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of property and equipment.

Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.

When significant parts of an item of property and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property and equipment.

The gain or loss on disposal of an item of property and equipment is determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property and equipment and is recognised net within "other income" and "other expenses" respectively in profit or loss.

#### (ii). Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing a component of an item of property and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Bank, and its cost can be measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced component is derecognised to profit or loss. The cost of the day-to-day servicing of property and equipment are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.

#### (iii). Depreciation
Depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value. Significant components of individual assets are assessed, and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, then that component is depreciated separately.

Depreciation is recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a declining basis except for buildings which is depreciated on a straight-line basis. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Bank will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Freehold land is not depreciated.

Depreciation is recognised from the date that the property and equipment are installed and are ready for use, or in respect of internally constructed assets, from the date that the asset is completed and ready for use.

The estimated useful lives for the current year are as follows:

| Asset Category                  | Rate          | Method       |
|---------------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Buildings                       | 5%            | Straight-Line|
| Leasehold improvements          | 20%           | Declining    |
| Furniture and fitting           | 25%           | Declining    |
| Computers and office equipment  | 25% - 50%     | Declining    |
| Motor vehicles                  | 25%           | Declining    |

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed at end of the reporting period and adjusted if appropriate.

### L. Intangible assets
Intangible assets, which comprise acquired computer software licenses and related costs, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment loss. Acquired computer software licenses are capitalised on the basis of the cost incurred to acquire the specific software and bring it to use.

### L. Intangible assets (cont.)
Intangible assets are amortised on a declining balance method at a rate of 50% per annum. Costs associated with the development or maintenance of computer software are recognised as expenses when incurred.

Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reassessed at end of the reporting period and adjusted if appropriate.

### M. Leases
At inception of a contract, the Bank assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.

To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Bank assesses whether:
- the contract involves the use of an identified asset - this may be specified explicitly or implicitly, and should be physically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a substantive substitution right throughout the period of use, then the asset is not identified;
- the Bank has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use; and
- the Bank has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Bank has this right when it has the decision-making rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used. In cases where the decisions about how and for what purpose the asset is used are predetermined, the Bank has the right to direct the use of the asset if either:
  - the Bank has the right to operate the asset; or
  - the Bank designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose it will be used.

At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease and non-lease component, the Bank allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component and aggregate of non-lease components on the basis of their relative stand-alone prices. However, for the leases of land and buildings in which it is a lessee, the Bank has elected not to separate non-lease components and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.

#### Leases in which the Bank is a lessee
An arrangement conveyed the right to use the asset if one of the following was met:
- the purchaser had the ability or right to operate the asset while obtaining or controlling more than an insignificant amount of the output;
- the purchaser had the ability or right to control physical access to the asset while obtaining or controlling more than an insignificant amount of the output; or
- facts and circumstances indicated that it was remote that other parties would take more than an insignificant amount of the output, and the price per unit was neither fixed per unit of output nor equal to the current market price per unit of output.

The Bank recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.

The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis as those of property and equipment. In addition, the right-of-use asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.

The estimated useful lives for the current period are as follows:
- Building and office branches: 5 – 10 years

The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, to the lessee's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Bank uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:
- fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments;
- variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date;
- amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and
- the exercise price under a purchase option that the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Bank is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Bank is reasonably certain not to terminate early.

The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in the lease term, a change in the assessment of the option to purchase the underlying asset, a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, or if

### M. Leases (cont.)
Leases in which the Bank is a lessee (cont.)
If there is a change in the Bank’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee.

When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit and loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.

Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets
The Bank has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases of machinery that have a lease term of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets, including IT equipment. The Bank recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

### N. Employee benefits
(i) Short-term employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Bank has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

(ii) Other long-term employee benefits
The Bank’s net obligation in respect of long-term employee benefits is the amount of the benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Remeasurements are recognised in profit and loss in the period in which they arise.

### O. Provisions
Provisions are recognised in the statement of financial position when the Bank has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost.

### P. Borrowing
Borrowing is initially measured at fair value minus incremental direct transaction costs, and subsequently measured at amortised cost using effective interest method.

### Q. Interest
Effective interest rate
Interest income and expense are recognised in profit and loss using the effective interest method. The ‘effective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to:
- the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or
- the amortised cost of the financial liability.

When calculating the effective interest rate for financial instruments other than purchased or originated credit-impaired assets, the Bank estimates future cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, but not ECL. For purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets, a credit-adjusted effective interest rate is calculated using estimated future cash flows including ECL.

The calculation of the effective interest rate includes transaction costs and fees and points paid or received that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Transaction costs include incremental costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of a financial asset or financial liability.

#### Amortised cost and gross carrying amount
The ‘amortised cost’ of a financial asset or financial liability is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured on initial recognition minus the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and, for financial assets, adjusted for any expected credit loss allowance.

The ‘gross carrying amount of a financial asset’ is the amortised cost of a financial asset before adjusting for any expected credit loss allowance.

#### Calculation of interest income and expense
The effective interest rate of a financial asset or financial liability is calculated on initial recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability. In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset (when the asset is not credit- impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. The effective interest rate is revised as a result of periodic re-estimation of cash flows of floating rate instruments to reflect movements in market rates of interest. The effective interest rate is also revised for fair value hedge adjustments at the date amortisation of the hedge adjustment begins.

### Q. Interest (cont.)
#### Calculation of interest income and expense (cont.)
However, for financial assets that have become credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts to the gross basis.

For financial assets that were credit-impaired on initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the credit-adjusted effective interest rate to the amortised cost of the asset. The calculation of interest income does not revert to a gross basis, even if the credit risk of the asset improves.

#### Presentation
Interest income calculated using the effective interest method presented in profit or loss includes interest on financial assets measured at amortised cost.

Interest expense presented in profit or loss includes interest on financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

### R. Fee and commission
Fee and commission income and expense that are integral to the effective interest rate on a financial asset or financial liability are included in the effective interest rate.

Other fee and commission income – including account servicing fees is recognised as the related services are performed.

A contract with a customer that results in a recognised financial instrument in the Bank’s financial statements may be partially in the scope of CIFRS 9 and partially in the scope of CIFRS 15. If this is the case, then the Bank first applies CIFRS 9 to separate and measure the part of the contract that is in the scope of CIFRS 9 and then applies CIFRS 15 to the residual.

### S. Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Bank’s non-financial assets (other than deferred tax assets) are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time. An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its related cash-generating unit (CGU) exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or CGU.

For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.

Impairment losses are recognised in profit and loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU (group of CGUs), and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUs) on a pro rata basis.

Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s

# Notes to the Financial Statements (Cont.)
_For the year ended 31 December 2021_

A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses and deductible temporary differences, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.

Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when the probability of future taxable profits improves.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

### 34. Significant accounting policies (cont.)
#### T. Income tax (cont.)
##### (ii). Deferred tax (cont.)
The measurement of deferred tax reflects the tax consequences that would follow the manner in which the Bank expects, at the reporting date, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if certain criteria are met.

#### U. Contingent liabilities
Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the obligation is not recognised in the statements of financial position and is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote. Possible obligations, whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events, are also disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the probability of outflow of economic benefits is remote.

#### V. Contingent assets
Where it is not possible that there is an inflow of economic benefits, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the asset is not recognised in the statements of financial position and is disclosed as a contingent asset, unless the probability of inflow of economic benefits is remote. Possible obligations, whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events, are also disclosed as contingent assets unless the probability of inflow of economic benefits is remote.

### 35. Change in significant accounting policies
The Bank applied the Phase 2 amendments retrospectively. However, in accordance with the exceptions permitted in the Phase 2 amendments, the Bank has elected not to restate comparatives for the prior periods to reflect the application of these amendments. Since the Bank had no transactions for which the benchmark rate had been replaced with an alternative benchmark rate as at 31 December 2020, there is no impact on opening equity balances as a result of retrospective application.

### 36. New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted
A number of new standards are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2021 and earlier application is permitted; however, the Bank has not early adopted the new or amended standards in preparing these financial statements.

#### A. Deferred tax related to assets and Liabilities arising from a single transaction (amendments to CIAS 12)
The amendments narrow the scope of the initial recognition exemption to exclude transactions that give rise to equal and offsetting temporary differences - e.g. leases. The amendments apply for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. For leases, the associated deferred tax asset and liabilities will need to be recognised from the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, with any cumulative effect recognised as an adjustment to retained earnings or other components of equity at that date. For all other transactions, the amendments apply to transactions that occur after the beginning of the earliest period presented.

The Bank accounts for deferred tax on leases applying the ‘integrally linked’ approach, resulting in a similar outcome to the amendments, except that the deferred tax impacts are presented net in the statement of financial position. Under the amendments, the Bank will recognise a separate deferred tax asset and a deferred tax liability. As at 31 December 2021, the taxable temporary difference in relation to the right-of-use asset is US$4,258,083 (see Note 14) and the deductible temporary difference in relation to the lease liability is US$4,968,478 (see Note 18), resulting in a net deferred tax asset of US$142,079 (see Note 21A). Under the amendments, the Bank will present a separate deferred tax liability of US$851,617 and a deferred tax asset of US$993,696. There will be no impact on retained earnings on adoption of the amendments.

#### B. Other standards
The following amended standards and interpretations are not expected to have a significant impact on the Bank’s financial statements:
- **Onerous contracts - cost of fulfilling a contract (Amendments to CIAS 37)**
- **COVID-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021 (Amendment to CIFRS 16)**
- **Annual Improvements to CIFRS Standards 2018 – 2020:**
  - **Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use (Amendments to CIAS 16)**
  - **Reference to Conceptual Framework (Amendments to CIFRS 3)**
  - **Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current (Amendments to CIAS 1);**
  - **Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to CIAS 1 and CIFRS Practice Statement 2);**
  - **Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to CIAS 8).**
